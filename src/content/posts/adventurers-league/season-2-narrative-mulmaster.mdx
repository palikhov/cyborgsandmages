Первая итерация карты Мулмастера, составленной игроками

Originally established as a trading-post, MULMASTER and its oppressed people are now ruled by a council of sixteen people known as BLADES who represent and further the interests of the city's NOBLE LORDS under the guidance of HIGH BLADE JASEEN DRAKEHORN. The High Blade relies heavily upon organizations such as CLOAKS, HAWKS, and THE SOLDIERY to maintain her control over the city; punishing MULMASTERITES bold (or foolish) enough to defy her edicts with exile, torture and death. At the lowest level, the CITY WATCH is charged with maintaining order within the city, but is regarded as little more than a band of government-sanctioned bullies. Above them all, the church of BANE holds sway in Mulmaster, and the High Blade and those loyal to her demonstrate their loyalty to the newly-returned god of Tyranny--all at the expense of its people. But try as she might, the High Blade's grip on the city is threatened. The mysterious RED WIZARDS OF THAY maintain an embassy within the city, REFUGEES from the recently-sacked town of PHLAN to the north stress the city's food stores, and even rumors surrounding the possible return of the former High Blade, SELFARIL UOUMDOLPHIN, are whispered in the darker parts of the city. All of these troubles, however, pale in comparison to the true threat to Mulmaster. The CULTS OF ELEMENTAL EVIL have taken up root within the city's walls and the city rots from within. Together and in opposition to one another, the cults vie for the creation of DEVASTATION ORBS, created by profane rituals at ELEMENTAL NODES. Once detonated, these orbs will unleash disaster on Mulmaster to a degree never before imagined.

## Elemental Evil: Mulmaster

## Glossary

BLADES. Originally constituted as a means of tempering the amount of control possessed by the High Blade, this council of 16 wealthy nobles has become little more than a group that exists to create, pass, and enforce laws based on the interests of their wealthy constituents. CITY WATCH. Widely regarded as lazy, inept, bullies; the City Watch is staffed with those who are considered too stupid or otherwise unsuitable for enlistment in the Soldiery. They charged with maintaining law and order at the lowest level, but typically beat wrong-doers to the verge of unconsciousness before throwing them into an alley or the harbor. CLOAKS. The rulers of Mulmaster hold magic in high suspicion and see its use as a direct threat to their power and the effectiveness of their leadership. As such, the use of magic is regulated and its practitioners watched, controlled and indoctrinated into the service of the city. Any mage who resides within the city is required by law to join the Cloaks upon penalty of exile. Those who refuse to join and are subsequently caught are dealt with harshly; penalties include torture, maiming, and often death. DEVASTATION ORB. Wildly powerful and equally unstable, these single-use magic items are created in the depths of elemental nodes. Soon after being removed from the node at which it is created, its power is unleashed; causing powerful earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, hurricanes or other catastrophic events depending on the orb's elemental type. ELEMENTAL EVIL. There are four elemental cults; each serving a different Prince of Elemental Evil devoted to the undoing of the world; reducing it to its most basic elemental states. These Princes are beings of pure destruction and those that worship them are wholly evil (and typically insane) and completely dedicated to their goals. ELEMENTAL NODE. Typically found in vast subterranean locations, elemental nodes are locations where the boundaries between the material and the elemental planes are thinned using secret knowledge and powerful elemental weapons wielded by one of the four prophets of the Elder Elemental Eye. The core of an elemental node houses an open two-way conduit allowing free travel to and from the plane to which it is connected. The raw energy from the nodes influences their surroundings; becoming reflections of the elemental planes themselves. HAWKS. The Hawks are a specialized sect of the city's standing army, and specialize in subterfuge and sabotage. While the Hawks are based within Mulmaster, their tasks take them throughout the Moonsea and nearby Dragonreach, where they gather intelligence, and conduct some of the Blades's secret and less scrupulous plots and schemes. HIGH BLADE JASEEN DRAKEHORN. The High Blade acts as the overall ruler of Mulmaster, acting on the guidance provided by the counsel of Blades. High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn, however, possesses the unquestioning loyalty of most of the Blades and the rest fear her too much to act against her. As such, she is more a dictator than anything else. MULMASTER. The former trading city exports fish, iron and ores and gems from nearby mines. Its oppressed people live in the shadow of the wealthy in perpetual fear of the Blades and their underlings. NOBLE LORDS. The 49 noble lords of Mulmaster are appointed by the popular vote of existing nobles when one of their members dies. Though anyone can petition to become a noble, success is typically determined by wealth and lineage. Male nobles carry the title Zor, while female nobles are called Zora. PHLAN. This once proud city on the northern shores of the Moonsea has recently fallen to Vorgansharax, a green dragon in the employ of the Cult of the Dragon. REFUGEES. The fall of Phlan has cast a number of its residents about the Moonsea; Mulmaster in particular. The body of a popular Knight of the Black Fist was brought to the city where she currently resides after being raised from the dead by her brother Wylan Burral; a cleric of Tymora within the city. RED WIZARDS OF THAY. Ruled by Szass Tam, this organization is peopled with wizards, demonologists, and slavers. Their presence in Mulmaster has caused suspicion and distrust in her residents. SELFARIL UOUMDOLPHIN. A former High Blade who, in 1375 DR was imprisoned within a soulgem by his twin brother Rassendyll Uoumdolphin under the guidance of Fzoul Chembryl. With Selfaril gone, Rassendyll allied the city with the Zhentarim. The soulgem is currently THE SOLDIERY. The city's army and navy are a conjoined force that defends the city in time of war. Pay is high and members of the Soldiery enjoy benefits above those of the City Watch, but must past rigorous tests of ability and loyalty. Those that excel in these tests further evaluated for enlistment in the Hawks. Members of the Soldiery are competent, effective and are held in regard by the people of Mulmaster.

## Themes

Each adventure must be attached to one or both of the themes below. Evil in Disguise (Storyline). The Cult of the Crushing Wave begin supplanting the worship of Umberlee with the local fishermen and sailors. Similarly, many miners begin to find their prayers answered by the Cult of the Black Earth. Monks from the Cult of the Howling Hatred enter the city and seek to offer control to the noble families by way of mystical breathing and more bizarre teachings. One of Mulmaster's chief exports is arms and armor, and within the forges of the City of Danger the Cult of the Eternal Flame gains traction with the smiths. Each cult has begun infiltrating the city with two distinct goals; first, the obliteration of Mulmaster through the use of elemental nodes and devastation orbs; and second, to do so before the other cults are able to. Echoes of the Past (Mulmaster). In 1375 DR, Rassendyll Uoumdolphin--the twin brother of the then High Blade Selfaril Uoumdolphin; and Fzoul Chembryl--an exarch of Bane, plotted to usurp Selfaril and imprison him in a soulgem. With Selfaril gone, Rassendyll assumes the position of High Blade in his stead and, in that capacity, allied the city of Mulmaster with its former enemy--the Zhentarim. Although decades have passed since Rassendyll's rise to (and eventual fall from) power his legacy remains, for in the gem set in the hilt of his sword, the tiniest spark burns with white-hot rage, the rage known only to a brother betrayed by his own blood. Word has begun to spread that the sword has been found and Jaseen Drakehorn and her Blades are worried.

## Mulmaster

Themes: Oppression, Corruption, Mild xenophobia Population: 50,000 in 1479 DR Races. Nearly all the people living in Mulmaster are human. Nonhumans include some halflings and dwarves, but elves, half-elves, half-orcs, gnomes, and others are remarkable sites in the city. Human ethnicity (be it Nar, Turmish, Chondatan, or something else) has less impact on folk's opinion of you than whether you are a native or a foreigner. Foreigners are typically viewed as easy marks or with suspicion. Culture. The people of Mulmaster are pessimistic dynamos. “Take what you can, when you can, because who knows if you'll see tomorrow,” would be their motto. The harsh landscape and living conditions as well as the history of the city have made Mulmasterites hardnosed, stubborn folk. They are constantly alert for any weaknesses in others, and their minds are always scheming to further their own positions. Mulmasterites are not foolish or reckless, mind you; they are (as a rule) single¬minded, driven, ambitious, and amoral folk. Mulmasterites set about life with a fierce determination. They push and push to achieve their ends, and die in the trying if need be. Neither zealots nor reckless idiots, they are inexorable, patient, relentless opponents, who wait for and exploit every weakness. It is this spirit that makes Mulmaster such a busy center for commerce, a hotbed of constant industry and intrigue. Mulmasterites love to live well when they can, going to taverns to drink, dance- houses to flirt and dance, and frequenting many other venues of entertainment such as fighting rings (bears vs. dogs, cocks, or people fighting one another), street theater, and gambling at the Gate of Good Fortune. Crime is rampant within the city and corruption is everywhere. Life is extremely cheap in Mulmaster. The average Mulmasterite is always looking to gain advantage on his or her neighbor, coworker, superior, or shopkeeper. Despite this cultural climate, Mulmaster is still a prosperous city, and the underclass is generally kept to one side as the wealthy and middle-class citizens delight in the epicurean products of the other cities of the Moonsea as well as far-off lands, and the city enjoys a raucous nightlife, if one knows where to look. Mulmasterites frequently wear furs to defend against the city's fierce winds, including leggings and “maliskers” (chest aprons) against the cold, with leather gauntlets and boots. Colors of orange, red, green, or gold are common in their clothes. The Beginnings Mulmaster began as a trading fortress in 934 DR. Very little is recorded about the city until nearly 400 years later when the ruler of Mulmaster--the sorcerer-king Neskar--was slain and his position assumed by the first High Blade, Amdrauth Telsnaer. His rule would be short-lived, however, and in the 30 years that would follow, both he and seven of his successors would be slain in office until the seat was seized by Selfaril Uoumdolphin. While there are disagreements on the manner of his replacement, it is commonly accepted that Selfaril was removed from office and replaced by his twin brother, Rassendyll Uoumdolphin, who would later ally the city with Fzoul Chembryl, an exarch of Bane. This collusion would later lead to Rassendyll accepting the assistance of the Zhentarim in establishing his borders and opposing the plots and schemes of the Red Wizards of Thay that operated within the city. Mulmaster Today Today, Mulmaster exerts control over little more than its own people; it owns no land, but occupies a strategic position close to the river Lis which allows it to control trade passing through the area. The Blades rule the city on behalf of the wealthy nobles and the church of Bane, and the people are, for the most part, do everything they can to scratch out a living in their shadow. The populace has been conditioned by fear and religion to obey without question, and the rich exploit this. High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn is on edge; between the slowly-growing presence of the factions in Mulmaster, the ever-mysterious Red Wizards of Thay, and strange goings on outside of the city, have her constantly shifting her attention to stem anything that would threaten her power or that of her church. Hawks have been sent abroad more frequently to ascertain external threats to the city and she has ordered that the Soldiery and the City Watch be increased in size to quell any uprisings or to defend the city in the event that the city is attacked. Tensions are high, and the High Blade cannot help but feel that her grip on the city is allowing more and more to slip between her fingers. Organizations The following are Mulmaster-specific organizations that possess a noticeable degree of influence in the city, along with the names and brief descriptions of noteworthy NPCs. The Blades The Blades are a council of sixteen nobles. The positions were originally established to provide representation for the nobles, and to temper the amount of control the High Blade possesses over the city. The Blades debate and vote on new laws which are, in turn, passed on to the High Blade, who either gives final approval and signs it into law, or vetoes it. While this system works in theory, many of the High Blades use bribery or intimidation to swing the votes of the Blades in their favor. The fact that the Blades are required by law to reside within the Tower of Blades is both a privilege and a means of control. While their families reside there, they remain under the implicit threat of soldiers who might be more loyal to the High Blade or other Blade members.

- High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn (juh-SEEN). The

current High Blade of Mulmaster has been in the service of Bane for her entire life. Abandoned on the steps of the Black Lord's Altar in Mulmaster as an infant, she was raised on the edicts of the faith and became a powerful paladin of Bane in her own right. She no longer swings a sword; she does him greater glory in subjugating an entire people in his name. While still relatively young, she is cold, calculating, and merciless in her dealings-- those who disobey, die. Her once dark hair has gone to grey and is closely-cropped. She has sharp and angular features, with piercing grey eyes. She is typically seen wearing fine clothing of blacks, grays, and reds; trimmed with white fur as is typical in Mulmaster. The Nobles The least powerful arm of the ruling body in Mulmaster is the nobles. There is a set number of noble Lords (forty-nine) in Mulmaster. These nobles win their appointments through the vote of existing nobles whenever one of their numbers dies. Anyone can petition to become a noble, but success or failure is typically determined by the candidate's lineage and current wealth. While this system seems orderly on the surface, a great deal of politicking is done through the assassin's blade. The nobles of Mulmaster are all but powerless except in name. Having the designation of nobility affords a family certain privileges and rights, but the opportunity to join the Blades is rare. Male nobles carry the honorific Zor, female nobles are called Zora. The lord of a noble house in Mulmaster can be either male or female; in either case, they are referred to as Lord.

- Typical Noble. The nobles of Mulmaster are a pampered and entitled lot, and they play the part well. All dress in expensive clothing of the local fashion, and treat those beneath them (which is more or less everyone) with the utmost contempt.

The Brotherhood of the Cloak Location: Cloak's Tower Magic can be a powerful threat to leadership. This threat is somewhat lessened if the practitioners of magic are watched, controlled, and indoctrinated into the service of the city. Whether or not this philosophy is correct is irrelevant, because it is the reason for the existence of the Cloaks. Any mage in residence in the city for longer than six months is required to join the Cloaks upon penalty of exile. Any mage who chooses not to join and is then caught casting a spell is dealt with harshly; penalties include torture, maiming, and often death. The Cloaks bear the responsibility of supporting the High Blade. Various tests of loyalty, both magical and mundane, are administered regularly, and those who fail face exile or death. The Cloaks thus act as a de-facto wing of Mulmaster's military and city watch. The cloaks are primarily wizards, but count a few sorcerers, bards, and even a warlock or two amongst their ranks.

- Senior Cloak Rastol Shan (RASS-tull SHAN).

Unbeknownst to the population of Mulmaster (including the High Blade) the Senior Cloak of Mulmaster, Rastol Shan, is a lich. He also has a deeper secret, his true identity is that of Thurdan Tallwand, the serving senior cloak during the rule (and subsequent fall) of Rassendyll Uoumdolphin. To facilitate his deception, Rastol is never seen without his most distinguishing feature, an elaborate, mithral mask. The long, white hair he wore in life is only slightly thinner in death, and spells and heavy perfume mask features remain that would betray his true nature. He is a cold, calculating man who supports the Blades in their dealings on the surface, but that loyalty would dissolve in an instant were he able to find a chink in their armor and assume control of the city for himself. While he is unaware of the cult's presence in the city (for now), he may view them as a means to take control of Mulmaster.

- Typical Cloak. Wizards to the core, they demonstrate their trade in cliché manners; robes, staffs, and other openly carried instruments of an arcane nature; albeit in the style and fashion of the city (i.e., fur-trim, etc.). They are fiercely loyal to the Blades and the city in general, and have been afforded a great deal of trust instilled in them. Despite this, they are professional and fair in their dealings. They typically do not accept bribery and react poorly when offered such.

The Hawks The second most important local organization is known as the Hawks. The Hawks are a special sect of the Mulmaster army, a paramilitary group of soldiers skilled in subterfuge and sabotage. The Hawks can be found in Mulmaster, but many can be located throughout the Moonsea and Dragonreach, gathering information and executing plots on behalf of Mulmaster's High Blade in secret.

- Rending Talon Groshin Lor (GROW-shin LORE).

Rending Talon Marr is a Banite through and through. Having been appointed to the post as one of High Blade Drakehorn's first acts, Marr is a cunning warrior and master of subterfuge. He is charming and has a natural gift for deception. His once handsome features are marred by a network of scars. These scars do not impede his ability to do field work, however, thanks to his ability to use disguise self; a gift from his fiendish warlock patron. He is whole-heartedly devoted to High Blade Drakehorn and would die before betraying her.

- Typical Hawk. The ranks of the Hawks are comprised of people from every walk of life, though most are rogues due to their training in stealth, deception and general thievery. They typically keep their affiliation private unless otherwise called for, as outing themselves limits their ability to perform their duties. They are intelligent, loyal, and have silver tongues.

The Soldiery Mulmaster's army and navy are a conjoined force referred to as the Soldiers or Soldiery. Pay is high and comes with privileges over both the normal citizens and City Watch, but potential members must past tests of military and seamanship worthiness as well as subtle tests of loyalty. Those who do well in the tests and prove loyal are subjected to other, secret tests. If they succeed in them, they are invited to join the Hawks.

- Typical Member of the Soldiery. The members of the Soldiery are widely considered to be the best and brightest of the city. Subject to rigorous testing of ability and loyalty, they are warriors and seamen without equal in Mulmaster. They are frequently seen throughout the city and are friendly, polite and competent. In the face of danger to the city, however, these features melt away and they exhibit a brutal, unparalleled savagery. They are loyal to the High Blade and the city. Attempting to bribe a member of the Soldiery will, more often than not, result in the arrest and imprisonment of the offender.

The City Watch The City Watch is largely made of those who flunk out of the soldiery for being too stupid, impetuous, lazy, or swift to anger. They have a well-earned reputation in the city for being bullies. In lieu of doing paperwork and true justice, an accused criminal, rowdy drunk, or anyone else who gets in their way often instead receives brutal beating and is tossed into an alley or the harbor.

- Typical Member of the City Watch. Those who are too stupid, lazy, or ineffective to serve in the Soldiery are remanded to the City Watch. Unfortunately, it is the City Watch that the residents of Mulmaster must most frequently deal with. Widely regarded as bullies, they are more likely to deal with a problem with violence and cruelty than with compassion and reason. Bribery is rampant among their ranks.

The Thayan Embassy The Red Wizards of Thay have maintained a presence in Mulmaster for over a century with a sizable embassy. One of the previous High Blades was even married to a Tharchioness of Thay, Dmitra Flass of Eltabbar, a Red Wizard. After Szass Tam assumed control of Thay, relations cooled somewhat, but Tha/s interest in the Moonsea diminished and shifted as the power of the Zhentarim waned and the returned Netherese made gains in Sembia. The Embassy had been staffed by necromancers until very recently. During that time the Cloaks kept a close eye on the Embassy, but over time it became apparent that the Thayans had no significant interest in the city except for purchasing magical reagents and ingredients that passed through and occasionally buying slaves to serve in their Embassy. Now that living Zulkirs and Tharchions again control much of Thay and most of the necromancers have been replaced by other wizards, Thay's interests in Mulmaster are once again unclear. They have been investing in the city and supplying diplomatic missions to journey to others. It seems they hope to use Mulmaster has a foothold for reintroducing their nation to other powers in the Moonsea and beyond. In the short term the reinvestment in the city is good, but the Blades fear that success in making connections with other states will make their own alliance with Thay less of a deterrent. Locations Within Mulmaster Tower of the Wyvern Although smaller than the Tower of the Blades, this castle is wholly the residence High Blade. The fine marble structure is decorated with ornate stained glass windows, the largest of which is found set into the tallest tower and features a wyvern. Nearly four hundred guards and soldiers and forty Cloaks serve here at the High Blade's pleasure, along with a couple hundred servants. For over a century the castle also hosted a subterranean complex of luxurious baths, exhibition stages, and leisure chambers known as the Palace of Revels. All manner of debauchery and depravity were rumored to occur in its candlelit halls, but since the assumption to the position of High Blade by a priest of Bane two decades ago, entrances to the Palace of Revels are said to have been bricked up. Tower of the Blades This opulent and expansive castle is home to the sixteen Blades who govern the city, with their families, servants, and bodyguards. A contingent of 300 soldiers and 30 cloaks also guard and staff the castle. The complex's entrances are always guarded with a six-man force, and each noble's wing of the complex is protected by various warding spells cast by Cloaks. This structure is also riddled with secret passageways and places to spy. There are several secret underground passages, some of which connect to one another, while other dungeon areas are isolated and can only be reached by passing through the rooms above. Tower of Arcane Might This massive stone tower complex houses the group of mages once known as the Brotherhood of the Cloaks. That archaic usage has fallen out of favor for their moniker, “The Cloaks.” The Cloaks serve the Blades of Mulmaster and are the only sanctioned spellcasters in the city where magic is otherwise outlawed. It has libraries, dormitories, laboratories, and vast storehouses of gold and magical items. The Tower is protected by golems, numerous defensive spells, and of course the magic and defenders of the Cloaks themselves. Southroad Keep Southroad Keep, Mulmaster's oldest building, is the heart of its bureaucracy, serving as the headquarters for the City Watch and tax collectors, as well as the site for Mulmaster's courts and prison. The squat, circular brick building serves as the constabulary headquarters, information center, tax-collection center, visitor's registration, courthouse, and prison. The building is nearly always crowded, and lines are long and slow. The inner chambers are constantly choked with throngs of people waiting to conduct business with the city, and the overworked officials are never in a great hurry to keep the lines moving. The prison lies underground and has approximately the same area as the aboveground portion. The gatehouse can seal off the city's south gate in the event of a siege. One hundred soldiers are posted here at all times, though the keep can house as many as six hundred when necessary. Storm Gate The Storm Gate is so named because it opens to the rocky beach on the Moonsea side of Mulmaster. As with Southroad Keep, the guards at Storm Gate carefully track and tax those who enter the city, but anyone who needs to be imprisoned is transported along the walls to Southroad Keep. Storm Gate is staffed by 20 soldiers and at least one Cloak at any hour lest invaders beach ships to attack. Zhent Ghettos When Zhentil Keep was destroyed, many Zhents fled to Mulmaster, seeking refuge. Mulmaster, however, had little interest in maintaining their alliance. Despite this, the Council of Blades eventually permitted the refugees to take up residence in the city, though to this day, they are still treated as outsiders. For the most part, they reside in the southern-most part of the city in sprawling ghettos that hug Mulmaster's outer walls. They are heavily taxed, denied the rights of citizenship, and persecuted by the city's government and its populace. The Zhent Ghettos are a dangerous place and the Cult of Elemental Evil exploits the resentful Zhentarim to their own ends. Temples & Shrines Though Bane is the primary focus of worship in Mulmaster, there are a number of temples in the city. Black Lord's Altar With the return of Bane just prior to the Spellplague, the seat of Banite worship has returned to Mulmaster, and the orthodox worshipers of Bane rededicated the Black Lord's Altar to Bane. This foreboding building is tall, with spines jutting out from the numerous locations on the exterior of the structure. Windows filled with red and violet glass reinforce its ominous appearance. Inside a statue of the Black Hand of Bane hangs down from the center ceiling, the arm reaching 50 feet down from the ceiling to have the gigantic hand hovering a mere eight feet above the floor. Melded with the structure of the temple, is seems to those who view it for the first time like Bane reaching down from the heavens.

- High Imperceptor Jorrul Missen (JORE-uhl MISS-in). Elevated to the position over 40 years ago, the High Imperceptor leads the congregation of the Black Lord's Altar. Jorrul Missen had just been appointed as the High Imperceptor when Jaseen Drakehorn was discovered on the Altar's stoop, and it was he that chose to raise her among the church. His influence within the city was such that it required little in the way of bribes and threats to see his prodigy eventually become the High Blade of Mulmaster; and through her, the church has seen previously unparalleled prosperity.

Jorrul Missen shorn head is covered in elaborate tattoos--more than are common among the clergy of Bane--which cover a number of pock-scars from some unknown childhood illness. His dark eyes are set deep into the ample flesh of his face; appearing like glittering gems among the folds of skin. His girth is substantial; such that he requires the use of a cane to move about. But what he lacks in grace or speed, he makes up for in power, for he is a spellcaster of surpassing power. He is usually seen wearing the black and red raiment of a cleric of Bane. High House of Hurting This is the temple of the Maiden of Pain, from which the wails of the faithful can be heard at all hours of the day and night. The structure is black, constructed from basalt blocks, and the rooms within closely resemble torture chambers. There is nothing here to provide comfort. One common feature of all the furniture in this structure is that causing pain is part of their design. The main sanctuary hall has no seating and nothing at all of comfort. The cult of Loviatar has always enjoyed a surprisingly strong cult in Mulmaster but since the closure of the Palace of Revels, it has increased in size. High Hall of Swords Built in the fashion of a castle, this granite building is the house of worship for those who pray to the god of battle. The exterior is decorated with broken shields, armor, and weapons that have been used in Tempus's name, while the battlements bear spikes decorated with the rotting heads of cowards. The clergy of the temple all also serve in Mulmaster's army or city watch. The temple is frequently the site of mock battles that allow soldiers and city watch members to train for siege and battle in buildings. Tower of Mysteries Magic radiates powerfully from this sky-blue building. This temple is a massive, sprawling structure with immense, airy rooms. In addition to the main worship and meditation chambers are numerous libraries and laboratories, as well as small shrines to other deities associated with the practice of magic such as Leria, Velsharoon, and Savras. Even a shrine to Mystra (to whom it is illegal to worship within the city) is tucked away in an alcove in this temple dedicated to wizardry. Since only Cloaks and visiting dignitaries are allowed to practice magic in the city, anyone entering the temple can expect to be confronted by one or more Cloaks who happen to be there at the time. Visitors must present papers that prove they're acknowledged mages that have sworn not to cast magic in the city or find themselves violently ejected. Gate of Good Fortune This large violet-painted temple is divided into two massive chambers: the worship chamber and the casino. The worship chamber is always bathed in a soothing purple light, and is a place for quiet but fervent prayer. The casino is where the “holy rites of Tymora” are carried out in the form of a multitude of games of chance. All house proceeds go to the upkeep of the temple, the clergy's living expenses, and the care of the needy, deserving, or the just plain lucky. The fortunes found in the casino are safe in a vault under the watchful eye of a clay golem.

- Lord Priest Wylan Burral (WHY-lun BURR-uhl).

Lord Priest Burral is the brother of Knight Aleyd Burral, the recently slain Knight of the Black Fist in Phlan; and a relatively low-ranking member of the church of Tymora. Wylan is the mirror opposite of his sister--passionate and jovial in contrast to her taciturn demeanor. Despite his seemingly friendly disposition, Wylan Burral is more than he seems; namely, the ranking member of the Cult of the Black Earth in Mulmaster, and has been for nearly a decade. Wylan is, on the surface, friendly and quick with a joke; eager to help in any way that any other cleric of Tymora would be willing. But in his guise as a cultist, his cheery disposition melts away and is replaced with malice. His passion remains though, and the combination is truly terrifying. House Built on Gold This temple of dedicated to Waukeen was abandoned for many years and robbed of much of its fittings and some of its stone. However, in the past year an effort has been made by a cadre of iron merchants and mine owners to refurbish the temple and rededicate it to Waukeen. The work is not complete. Masons, gilders, painters, sculptors, and others tramp in and out constantly, but already the temple has opened its services as a bank and lender, backing the money with the fortunes of its wealthy and hard-minded sponsors. Shrine to Lathander This shrine stands near Southroad Keep on the hill to its south where the rising sun over the mountains can strike the shrine without it being shadowed by the walls. The shrine consists of a bronze symbol of Lathander on a bronze post, made so that light can shine through the body of the rising sun and the road. Folk setting out for points south or making a business deal frequently come to the shrine in daylight hours to take Lathander's blessing upon their enterprises. The path to and from the shrine is thus well worn. Shrine to Malar A dim and dismal shack stands on the northern side of Southroad Keep. Decorated with bird's wings and the feet of various land-bound prey, the shrine to Malar can be a noisome and fly-ridden place. Even so, those who leave the city to hunt in the mountains frequently stop inside to honor Malar and return here with a portion of their kill if the hunt proves successful. Shrine to Mask The shrine to Mask is an oddity standing as it does in the open street. Most places holy to the god of stealth and skullduggery tend to be hidden away. In Mulmaster, however, Mask is worshiped by all manner of individual hoping for a way to get ahead. The shrine takes the form of a changing chamber built to look like a cloaked and masked two-faced figure of about 12 feet tall, man on one side and woman on the other. One always enters the shrine by opening one “arm” of the figure, either the male or female side, and then exiting the other. Custom dictates that you must be masked and costumed when entering and then exchange you mask and costume for another when exiting. Thus, in theory, no one can know who is worshiping at the shrine to Mask. There are always over a dozen costumes inside, and traditional favorites rotate in and out as individuals take it upon themselves to make repairs on them. Shrine to Talos The rocky beach outside the walls is frequently battered by storms, and a shrine to Talos is therefore erected on the beach. Those who use the beach make a habit of adding a piece of driftwood to a pile that by month's end (if it survives the weather) is a precarious tower that adherents must climb to build upon. Climbing the high towers is considered an act of great faith to Talos sure to protect the climber from misfortune. On the last night of the month, whatever tower stands is set ablaze. Sometimes it amounts to little more than a bonfire, but at other times a tower 30 to 40 feet tall blazes on the beach with those seeking Talos's favor dancing wildly round it, waiting until the last moment to break the circle should the fiery tower fall their way. Shrine to Umberlee The Shrine to Umberlee is on the west side of what is locally known as the Last Drop because of the custom of people to commit suicide by tying weights to themselves and jumping off into the deep waters below. The shrine to Umberlee is a sculpture of a furious female face carved into the balustrade with a gaping mouth that opens to the water below. Folk wishing to appease or thank Umberlee drop offerings to her through the mouth. People believe the spirits of those who commit suicide by plunging from the bridge guard the offerings given to Umberlee and thus they are left unmolested. Inns & Taverns Traveler's Cloak Inn A favorite inn of wealthy travelers, the Traveler's Cloak offers a welcome retreat from the cold and damp. Each room has its own fireplace, and dinner and drink are included in the rather steep nightly price of 12 gp (15 gp if a mount needs to be stabled). Black Blade and Bloody Boar The Black Blade and Boar--recognizable by its sign-- a wooden sculpture of a boar impaled with a rusty iron sword. The inn has a raucous tavern Windsnug Hearth This inn was built in a part of town where it's mostly sheltered from mountain winds. Food and drink is simple fair served en-suite. As a location that typically serves travelers and visiting merchants, its guests are frequently the target of con artists or muggers who watch those who exit for likely marks. The Leaning Boot The Leaning Boot is a tavern in the cellar of a dockside tallhouse. For decades it has been marked only by a lone, old boot nailed to a post at the top of the steps at street level. The interior is dimly lit and tends to be quiet, making the subterranean bar a favorite of the few dwarves in Mulmaster, older locals, and a handful of dedicated drinkers. The cellars are damp, making corked bottles swell and burst open over time. As a result, only ale, beer, and other vat fermented beverages are served. Locations Outside Mulmaster Earthspur Mountains Also called the Giantspike or Dragonspike Mountains, this range of tremendously tall mountains spans the gap between the Moonsea and the Sea of Fallen Stars. The mountains are rich in precious metals and many old, dry mines can be found throughout. The following locations are located in the Earthspur Mountain range:

- Glacier of the White Worm. This immense glacier covers an approximate are of 1200 square miles. It is so named for the white remorhazes that reside within. Rumors tell of entire herds of the terrifying beasts ruled by a remorhaze of tremendous size.
- Monastery of the Yellow Rose. East of the Glacier of the White Worm, this monastery is the home to an order of disciples of Saint Sollars the Twice Martyred; a follower of Illamater.

Elmwood This small farming community lay on the southern shore of the Moonsea and west of Mulmaster. It is loosely governed by Graffin Jorgadaul, the descendent of Thoyana Jorgadaul. Whether the Cult of Elemental Evil's influence has made it this far west is unknown. It is governed by Graffin Jorgadaul, a retired dwarven adventurer with one arm. Ironfang Keep This mysterious keep was built long before recorded history and housed a secretive order of mages so powerful that even some of the most powerful wizards in history were hesitant to disturb them. A vast, subterranean complex exists beneath the keep; its entrance shielded from view by the waterfall that falls from the peak where the keep rests. River Lis A shallow, swampy river connecting the Moonsea to the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Lis delta was once home to a large city of the same name. It and a number of sites around it are now in ruin.

- The Flooded Forest. A large swamp in the northern portion of the Vast. It is inhabited by lizardfolk and until recently, a black dragon. It is rumored that an adventuring group called the Turning Key hid its treasure in the Flooded Forest.
- Fort Dalton. Fort Dalton was long ago destroyed by a migration of dragons, but its ruins remain. Rumors tell of cults practicing their dark rites within its depths.
- The Mage’s Tower. No one knows for sure who built the tower or even who lives there to this day. Rumored residents have included Maskyr One- Eye, mind flayers, dwarves, Lashan Aumersair, the Mage Who Never Dies, and even a gold dragon. What is known for sure, however, is that the tower boasts powerful guardians including golems, gargoyles, and magical traps.
- Point Iron. This profitable iron mine is controlled by Mulmaster after the city purged it of the duergar who had previously been residing within.
- The Lis Ruins. Lis was a city located west of Mulmaster and was destroyed by a Flying Plague; a horde of perytons, harpies, and manticores.

The Vast This region of Faerun between the River Lis and the Earthspur Mountains to the west and east, and the Moonsea and the Sea of Fallen Stars to the north and south. It has been the home of orc, elvish, dwarven, and human rulers throughout its history.

- Kurth. Known as Pirate's Rest, Kurth is a town located in the northern portion of the Vast. Founded by the pirate Kurth Banditslayer, Kurth was a large town that eventually fell to orc raids. Its current state is much smaller; and more easily able to defend against attacks, and the outer

portions of the city have fallen into ruin, including Feljack's Hall; the former home of an adventurer of the same name. Skeletal pirates have been seen in the area of Feljack's Hall, seemingly searching for the long-dead owner's fabled treasure.

- Maskyr's Eye. A village located on the North road between Mulmaster and Kurth. Originally founded by the archmage Maskyr, the vale where he settled, was claimed by the dwarves of Roldilar. Thinking that the mage would refuse the offer, the Deep King Stonebeard offered the vale to Maskyr if the mage would pluck out his right eye; which Maskyr did without hesitation. True to his word, the Deep King declared the vale the realm of Maskyr's domain and no dwarf has laid claim to it since.
