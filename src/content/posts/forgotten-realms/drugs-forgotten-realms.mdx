# Drugs of the Realms

## Drugged (Condition)

- A drugged creature is affected by the drug in their system. Each drug has different mechanics.
- A drugged creature may make a save against the effects of that drug at a regular interval, with the first save being made at the first interval after the drug was imbibed.
- If this save is failed, the drug's effects persist, but the DC is reduced by 2 for each interval afterwards, cumulative, until the save is made.

## Alindluth

## Katakuda

Magical • 50 gp per dose Also known as "Dragonskin". Imported from the distant Kara-Tur, this drug was developed by an order of fighting monks of that land.

## Mordayn Vapor

Natural • 100 gp per dose Also known as "Dreammist". Made from roughly ground leaves of a rare herb found in southern forests, Mordayn is so potent that it is made from steeping a small amount into boiling water and then inhaling the vapors of the resulting tea. Raw Mordayn power and Mordayn-tainted water are a deadly poison; taking the powder directly or drinking the tea produces an immediate overdose.

- Addiction:High (Wisdom)

Alchemical • 10 gp per dose Also called "Phantomdust," Oruighen is made by refining rare cacti found in the alkaline sands of Azulduth, the Lake of Salt. It is a gray, fine-grained dust normally carried in small paper envelopes. It can temporarily blind and disable anyone unfortunate enough to inhale a pinch, and is popular with rogues and assassins who want a quick way to discourage those who interfere with their work.

## Panaeolo

## Tansabra

Alchemical • 100 gp per dose When injected (it must reach the bloodstream), this mixture of particular creature venoms causes complete “system shutdown” in mammals. This means that breathing is suspended, the body temperature “holds,” the need for oxygen ceases, bleeding stops, any internal bleeding and tearing is healed (unless fresh wounds are induced), acids and toxins suspend their operations on the body, and the recipient loses consciousness. In effect, the body is placed in stasis. Certain little-known arcane and divine spells can force release from “tansabra sleep,” and there are rumors that certain rare gem powders and herbs can shock someone out of tansabra sleep, but otherwise, an affected being emerges from the effects of tansabra at a random time. Creatures in tansabra sleep don’t heal naturally, and magical healing doesn’t affect them. Repeated exposure to tansabra can kill an individual, but how much exposure is lethal varies randomly from being to being. A lethal dose is not related to the amount of the drug administered — it depends on a person’s tolerance for the number of distinct times his body undergoes the effects.

- Type:Injected •Save:None •Interval:None
- Effect:
- Immediate:The user gains the Unconscious condition; the user appears dead to all non-magical examination. The user may immediately spend up to half his available hit dice as healing, but can benefit from no other healing, magical or otherwise. This condition lasts for 1d6 days.
- Overdose:Each individual has a secret number of times they may enter into tansabra sleep; the DM rolls a single die, of the type that is the largest hit die for the creature in question when it first if affected by this drug. This is the maximum number of times the creature mayeverenter such sleep; when it uses tansabra one time more than this limit, it enters the sleep and then dies in 1d4 hours.
- Addiction:None

## Tekkil

Natural • 3 gp per dose This fat, red leaf releases a milky juice when chewed. The juice is an analgesic, and is sometimes used by people suffering from extreme or chronic pain. Addicts who seek to numb their senses and submerge themselves in a drug-induced stuper use it in greater doses.

- Type:Ingested •Save:Constitution DC 10 •Interval:One hour
- Effect:The user's pain sensitivity is numbed greatly, at the expense of his energy.
- While in Effect:The user gains damage resistance 1 against all attacks that inflict bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, and force damage.
- While in Effect:The user suffers disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks and saves.
- Overdose:If a second dose is taken while the first is still in effect, it causes a numbing stupor for 2d4 hours. The user suffers the Poisoned condition, with the additional effects of halving the user's speed, and allowing it to useeitheran action or a bonus action during its turn but not both.
- Addiction:Medium (Wisdom)

## Ziran

Alchemical • 50 gp per dose Known as the "Bloodfast," this is a bitter white powder usually compressed into a tablet. Ziran is manufactured from several Underdark fungi by the drow. Its secret has reached the surface, and some alchemists have begun to cultivate farms of the appropriate mushrooms.

- Type:Ingested •Save:Constitution DC 15 •Interval:One hour
