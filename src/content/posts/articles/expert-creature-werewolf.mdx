**Shapechanger.** The werewolf can use its action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in  each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Regeneration.**The werewolf regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the werewolf takes damage from attack made with silvered weapon, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the werewolf’s next turn. The werewolf dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate. Any spell or effect that deny creature’s ability to regain hit not work on this regeneration. This ability can’t restore lost limbs.

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Pack Tactics.**The werewolf has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the werewolf ‘s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
