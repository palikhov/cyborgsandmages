(Mirtul, 'month of melting', RoS pg 57 )  
(\*Note: The year of RoS is a pure guess of mine, but as the status quo of the Campaign Guide/ 1479 DR Year of the Ageless One is put aside it must be in or after that year. I suppose that the return of Malar to the Moonshaes might be interpreted as one of the first signs of the Sundering.)

(Note: In the comic Ravengard is asked 'how he is shouldering his new position (as Duke)' so it seems that he only recently took over the position. As he is holding 'court' within the Watch Citadel and wears Flaming Fist armor it seems that he inherited his former superiors duties as Marshall of the Flaming Fist as well.)

(Note: According to information from the Adventurer's League the 'Tyranny of Dragons' arc takes place in 1489 DR and according to pg.10 of the TRoT Adv. the adventures take place 'after the Sundering'. But the novel 'Archmage' tells us, that Tiamat's gamble for power had already failed at the end of 1485DR. \[See D: A pg. 2\] Additionally the Adventure mentions Connerad Brawnanvil as ambassador of the dwarves to the 'Lord's Alliance', but Connerad dies in 'Archmage'/ 1486 DR. \[See: D: A pg.282/ 356\] The mentioning of Connerad stepping down as king (TRoT Adv. pg.15) is also wrong, as he is still king at the time of his death. \[See D: A pg 282\])

Some of their followers still war with each other, but the two deities do not. Thus far, Eilistraee‚Äôs teachings after the Sundering are the same as before the Sundering. (Source ED)  
Eilistraee, the Dark Dancer is seen dancing and speaking to mortals up and down the Sword Coast (E:DM pg. 106)

Many nobles and guildmasters of the city are vying for the attention of or conspire against the new Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, while trying to use the transition to get rid of rivals This political chaos, that many of the city's residents consider 'business as usual', will still not be resolved in 1491 DR (PotA Adv. pg. 38)  
(Note: According to 'The Herald' Laeral spend most of her time searching for clues about Khelbens work concerning the Weave at Candlekeep. So her appearance in the Tiamat adventure is wrong assuming my corrections concerning the date of that adventure derived from the dates taken from the Salvatore novels are correct. As the adventure was placed within this year I placed Laeral's appearance as Open Lord here.)

Lady Seasilver, now Grand Duchess of Marsember and Kleef Kenric return home to Marsember. (S:TS pg.295)

(Note concerning 'Legacy of the Crystalshard': Although a note placed the Adventure in 1485DR, this makes little sense, as 'Archmage' states, that Dain Stokley Silverstream is only freed from drow slavery in Nightal 1486 DR (D: A pg.348) and the Hosttower of Luskan is about to be restored (D: A pg.360). )

Elminster is convinced by Larloch to help him use the energies of Candlekeeps wards to strengthen the Weave.

**1488 DR Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn**

Throughout much of Faerun, the winter of 1487 and 1488 lasted longer than any on record. The solstices and equinoxes had somehow drifted. Later seasons followed suit, with each starting and ending later than expected. (SCAG pg.18)

Late Tarsakh (Spellstorm Begins)  
Cormyr/Suzail: The Dragon Rampant Club is burned to the ground after a wild spell duel between Manshoon and Shaaan the Serpent Queen.

The archmages assembled are Elminster of Shadowdale, Manshoon (once of the Zhentarim), Malchor Harpel (once of Longsaddle and still of the returned Twilight Tower), Tabra, Maraunth Torr, Skouloun and Yusendre (two surviving Elders of Nimbral), Runemaster Calathlarra of the Twisted Rune, Shaaan the Serpent Queen, Alastra Hathwinter of the Harpers, Laragunt of Threskel and an unnamed Red Wizard. The later two, spooked by their loss of magical power flee back into the Spellstorm and are turned insane by it. (E:S pg.56-63). The 'negotiations' for the ownership of the Lost Spell that take place inside 'Oldspires' claim the lives of archmages Maraunth Torr, Skouloun and Yusendre of Nimbral, Runemaster Calathlarra, Shaaan the Serpent Queen and Alastra Hathwinter.

**1489 DR Year of the Warrior Princess**

Many of the wars begun in the Sundering come to a close. (SCAG pg.18)

Flamerule  
Following Flamerule, Vhaeraun and Eilistraee are separate deities with the same powers and portfolios they had before 1375, but a new understanding, respect, and even friendship for each other. Some of their followers still war with each other, but the two deities do not. Thus far, Eilistraee‚Äôs teachings after the Sundering are the same as before the Sundering. (Source ED)  
Eilistraee, the Dark Dancer is seen dancing and speaking to mortals up and down the Sword Coast (E:DM pg. 106)

Waterdeep: Laeral Silverhand replaces Dagult Neverember as Open Lord of Waterdeep. (TRoT Adv. pg 14). Dagult, after losing Waterdeep, consolidates his power by concentrating his efforts as Lord-Protector of Neverwinter (TRoT Adv.pg. 15). Many nobles and guildmasters of the city are vying for the attention of or conspire against the new Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, while trying to use the transition to get rid of rivals This political chaos, that many of the city's residents consider 'business as usual', will still not be resolved in 1491 DR (PotA Adv. pg. 38)  
(Note: According to 'The Herald' Laeral spend most of her time searching for clues about Khelbens work concerning the Weave at Candlekeep. So her appearance in the Tiamat adventure is wrong assuming my corrections concerning the date of that adventure derived from the dates taken from the Salvatore novels are correct. As the adventure was placed within this year I placed Laeral's appearance as Open Lord here.)

**1490 DR Year of the Star Walker's Return**

Dessarin Valley: Cultist of the Elemental Eye try to add Nurvureem, the 'Dark Lady' of Rundeth Manor, to their ranks, but the 'drow dragon' declines the offer by killing most of the cult's envoys. (PotA Adv. pg.36, 179-180) (Note: several months before the adventure begins)

**1491 DR Year of the Scarlet Witch**

The floating shanty-town district Mistshore burns (E: DM, pg.22) and the harbor is returned to it's original function (SCAG pg.55, E:DM pg.). The Melairshield (CW pg.20) seems to be damaged, as houses collapse into Downshadow Digging below the city without permission is declared illegal. (SCAG pg. 55, E:DM pg.72-73)  
Cloud Giants lead by a giant named Burrult visit Waterdeep in their cloud castle in search of Princess Irie, daughter of storm giant king Skyvald (E:DM pg.59)  
(Note: probably foreshadowing the events of 'The Storm King's Thunder'-Adventure)  
Open Lord Silverhand orders to restore the Guard, Watch, Navy and it's Griffon Cavalry to it's original functions. But Laeral doesn't want to refound Force Grey just yet. (SCAG pg 55, E:DM pg. 64, 144-146)  
Masked Lord Braethan Cazondur's tries to become ruler of Waterdeep. His bid for power claims the lives of several of his fellow Masked Lords as well as those of about a dozen guildmasters. During his fight with Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, Cazondur is slain by his own allies, after those received orders from their master, the Xanathar to stop the Masked Lord, whose ambitions didn't sit well with the crimelord's goals. (E:DM pg.370-371)  
Open Lord Silverhand opens the assemblies of the Lords of Waterdeep to all guildmasters and nobles who want to attend to watch and listen.(E:DM pg.381)  
( Note: 'Death Masks' ends)

**The argument that Season 5 (Storm King‚Äôs Thunder) is set in 1492**

**Season 1: Tyranny of Dragons (Hoard of the Dragon Queen / Rise of Tiamat) took place in 1489‚Ä¶**

State of Phlan ([http://dndadventurersleague.org/storyline-seasons/tyranny-of-dragons-premier-adventures/phlan-during-tyranny-of-dragons/](http://dndadventurersleague.org/storyline-seasons/tyranny-of-dragons-premier-adventures/phlan-during-tyranny-of-dragons/)):

‚ÄúTo learn the state of Phlan is to understand her many trials and tragedies.‚Äù ‚Äì Lord Sage of Phlan, 1489 DR‚Äù (1489 is officially referenced elsewhere, too)

**Season 2: Elemental Evil (Princes of the Apocalypse) took place in 1491‚Ä¶**

p.19 of the Elemental Evil hardcover:

Time in the Realms (Sidebar, Princes of the Apocalypse page 19): ‚ÄúThe people of the Forgotten Realms number the years by the Dalereckoning calendar, which is abbreviated ‚ÄúDR.‚Äù Years are also given names, which are drawn from the writings of a great seer from long ago. The adventure is set in 1491 DR, the Year of the Scarlet Witch.‚Äù

**The first timeline wrinkle comes from Season 3: Rage of Demons (Out of the Abyss). No specific date was mentioned in the adventure, but some of the events of the storyline were portrayed in a Salvatore novel set in the mid-1480s (so before Tyranny of Dragons). However, Season 3 of Adventurer‚Äôs League took place after Season 2. But, as Chris Perkins notes, Out of the Abyss overlaps with the seasons** (presumably it took a while for the demon lords to enact their plans)‚Ä¶

Chris Perkins from Wizards of the Coast at Gamehole Con 2015 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0m6MFokHL8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0m6MFokHL8), 78:26):

‚ÄúSo, yeah, Tyranny of Dragons happened. Elemental Evil happened. Out of the Abyss happened. They're actually not sequential if you, if you look at the time lines very carefully, Out of the Abyss happens, kind of overlaps with the other two and actually has nods in it to the other two.‚Äù

**More evidence from AL Admin Greg Marks that Season 3 takes place after Season 2 (and thus during 1491)‚Ä¶**

Facebook (I can‚Äôt figure out how to perma-link to a Facebook post, but I saved this):

Greg Marks (October 24, 2015 at 8:55am): ‚ÄúIt is assumed season three happens after season two. Less than a year has passed.‚Äù

**Also confirmed by AL Admin Travis Woodall‚Ä¶**

Facebook (likewise no perma-link):

Jaime Pierson (June 3, 2015): ‚ÄúNot sure if it has already been asked but what is the current year in the Forgotten Realms?‚Äù

Travis Woodall (June 3, 2015 at 10:55am): ‚Äú1491 DR‚Äù

**And since Season 3 took place in the summer of 1491‚Ä¶**

DDEX3-8: The Malady of Elventree:

‚ÄúThis adventure begins during Second Feast (summer solstice)‚Ä¶‚Äù

**‚Ä¶ and Season 4 takes place in Winter, Season 4 presumably takes place at the start of the 1491-1492 winter‚Ä¶**

Moonsea Mists ([http://dndadventurersleague.org/moonsea-mists/](http://dndadventurersleague.org/moonsea-mists/)):

Season 4 opens for the D&D Adventurers League with an unusually cold winter seizing the Moonsea region. As the displaced of Phlan march with their allies to retake their home from Vorgansharax, the Maimed Virulence, strange mists and even stranger events are rising. It is cold, dark, and you have the feeling something just out of sight is watching you with hungry interest.

**More information on the order of seasons from the Season 4 epic page‚Ä¶**

Season 4 Epic Information ([http://dndadventurersleague.org/dd-epic-reclamation-of-phlan-release-schedule/](http://dndadventurersleague.org/dd-epic-reclamation-of-phlan-release-schedule/)):

The Season 4 Epic: Reclamation of Phlan wraps up a story arc that was started in Season 1. In Tyranny of Dragons the green dragon known as the Maimed Virulence took over the town of Phlan. In Season 2 as refugees from Phlan many characters worked with the Zors and other groups in Mulmaster to gain the needed support to take back Phlan, but plans had to be halted due to the city being nearly destroyed by the cults of Elemental Evil. During Season 3 the demons erupting from the underdark caused further delays in the retaking of Phlan, but now that the demons have been pushed back into the abyssal home Phlan becomes the focus and the opportunity to strike at Vorgansharax, the Maimed Virulence is at hand!

**Based on a reading of Storm King‚Äôs Thunder, it doesn‚Äôt seem to take place in the winter, so since winter is over it‚Äôs presumably now 1492 ‚Äì which places it a couple of years after the end of Tyranny of Dragons, as confirmed by Chris Perkins‚Ä¶**

Storm King‚Äôs Thunder Information ([http://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/06/03/storm-kings-thunder-explained-video-transcription/](http://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/06/03/storm-kings-thunder-explained-video-transcription/)):

Backstory ‚Äì before elves, dwarves, and humans settled the Sword Coast, the land was ruled by dragons and giants and they hated each other. When the more ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù races moved in, the dispute died down, but was never settled to either side‚Äôs satisfaction. Fast forward 40,000 years and you have the modern Sword Coast. A couple of years ago, Tyranny of Dragons happened. The dragons tried to bring back Tiamat. The ‚Äúsmall races‚Äù didn‚Äôt agree and thwarted that plot. The giants did nothing.

(‚ÄúCouple‚Äù, in an idiomatic usage, meaning more than two \[[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/couple](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/couple)\]:

Idioms

14\. a couple of, more than two, but not many, of; a small number of; a few: It will take a couple of days for the package to get there.)

**Therefore, Storm King‚Äôs Thunder is set during 1492.**
