# Archetypes

## ALLEYBLADE

The title “alleyblade” arose in Waterdeep, and it denotes one who not only survives, but thrives, in the most hardscrabble slums of unforgiving cities. As an alleyblade, you excel in recognizing and seizing opportunity. Even outside civilized walls, you retain a keen sense for sudden threats and the weaknesses of foes. Whether you meet life's unpredictabilities with wry wit or scheming self-interest, you've seen it all.

### IN THE REALMS

“Alleyblade” began as upper-class Waterdhavian slang in the 14th century, yet those labelled soon claimed it for themselves. Rogues from Baldur's Gate and Luskan on the Sword Coast to Westgate and Nathlekh on the Dragon Coast have adopted the title, which they wear as a badge of honor.

### Running Slash

At 3rd level, you've mastered the art of making a swift cut to a target's limb, crippling pursuit before retreating to a safe distance. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making a melee attack with a weapon that inflicts slashing damage, you can deal your sneak attack damage with that attack, even if you don't have advantage. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack feature still apply to you.

In addition, when you deal your sneak attack damage, until the end of the target's next turn, its speed is reduced by 10 feet and it can't make opportunity attacks against you.

### Infuriating T aunt

At 3rd level, you are adept at taunting an enemy's failure, and can bait even unintelligent foes into recklessness. You gain proficiency with the Deception skill if you don't already have it. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails an ability check or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to roll a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you succeed, the target takes psychic damage equal to id6 + your proficiency bonus. When a creature takes psychic damage from this feature, it has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

Once you successfully inflict psychic damage with this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Fool’s Dance

Starting at 9th level, when you use your Uncanny Dodge feature as a reaction, if there are three or more hostile creatures within 5 feet of you, as part of the same reaction you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Misdirection

Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.

### Unlikely Escape

When you reach 17th level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to quickly free yourself from situations that impede you. When you do so, you end any of the following conditions that are afflicting you: grappled, paralyzed, prone, restrained, or stunned. In addition, if your speed has been reduced, it is restored to normal. When you use your bonus action in this way, until the end of the turn, your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, you are immune to the listed conditions, and your speed cannot be reduced. As part of the same bonus action, you can move up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## CUTTHROAT

Cutthroats are unrepentant killers who make their living by preying on those weaker than themselves. They associate with those who operate outside the law and often band together with other nefarious rogues for a common purpose. Cutthroats typically earn their living by accepting payment for murder or by robbing the corpses of their victims, but some accept employment as bodyguards or hired thugs.

Many cutthroats learn their murderous trade by simply surviving in the gloom-haunted streets of places like Blackwater or in other villainous dens scattered throughout the Iron Kingdoms. Regardless of where they learned the finer points of their craft, cutthroats are skilled at stalking their victims and striking a fatal blow from the shadows.

### BACKSTAB

At 3rd level, you are an artisan of twisting the knife into the back of an unsuspecting foe. When you deal sneak attack damage to an enemy with a melee weapon attack, you may choose one of the following options.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### THUG

At 9th level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. Additionally, you can attempt to terrorize a humanoid within 30 feet of you into cowering in fear as a bonus action.

If you succeed, the creature is frightened for a number of rounds equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of 1 round).

Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Insight and Investigation skills and have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.

Starting at 9th level, you learn to adopt special stances that allow you to adapt to different com­bat situations. You may adopt one of the following stances as a bonus action.

You may reroll each dice only once.

## DUELIST

The roguish duelist is a lightly armored combatant who favors quick, precise attacks with a light weapon in each hand. The duelist is murderously effective when fighting one-on-one. The quick, resourceful, and precise duelist may look like an artist, but more often he or she is just another killer for hire—but one with a dashing and lethal sense of style.

After using this ability, you must complete a long rest before using it again.

## MINSTREL

There have always been those who understand the power of performance through words in poetry, song, stories, and speeches. Minstrels perform as musical entertainers. Storytellers chronicle the deeds of legends as tales. Orators deliver rousing speeches with persuading rhetoric. Poets use the art of wordcraft to describe ideas and scenes.

Once this effect ends, if the creature was forced to do something it would not normally do, it may make another Wisdom saving throw to realize something was affecting its mind, at which point it will become hostile.

You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.

## RAKE

A common sight in the courts of Alphatia and Thyatis, rakes are famed for their glib tongue and courtly intrigues. Your weapons are a quick mind and keen intellect. Where other rogues study locks, you learn secrets. You are ready to make friends and even quicker to use them to your advantage. Contacts are your weapon of choice. Knowledge is a definite asset, and one you never pass up an opportunity to expand upon.

Rakes are usually found in the courts and noble houses of the more civilized nations. They are especially prevalent in the empires of Alphatia and Thyatis. Many rakes are minor nobles and are often second sons or daughters of the nobility. Most are content playing games of intrigue as courtiers, to increase their family's power or their own. Some rakes decide to explore the world, either to improve their power through adventuring or because they have been exiled for any number of indiscretions. Rakes rely on charm and wits rather than a strength of arms, making them far more useful in urban settings than dungeons.

Their ability to make allies and gain support from authorities makes them indispensable.

### Courtly Indiscretion

Because of your need for disguise, or for less savory activities, you can get dressed or undressed quickly. At 3rd level, you halve the time needed to don or doff light armor, with help, you reduce the time to a single round. You can also take an outfit on or off in a single round.

### Legend in Your Own Mind

At 13th level you have become a beacon of self confidence. You have developed mental defenses because of your assuredness. You cannot be charmed, and you have advantage on any saving throw against Psychic damage.

### Name Level

At 17th level your reputation precedes you. Any non-hostile intelligent NPC that comes within 30 feet of you must pass a Charisma save against DC 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. If the NPC fails they are charmed for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. This effect ends if you leave the area, insult or harm the NPC. A creature only has to make a single saving throw once per day.

You don't pay me to think; you pay me to kill. I'll go on your boat, I'll lead your boarding party, and I'll fill their bilge with their blood. But thats all I'll do. Don't expect me to swab the deck, salute your officers, or pay attention told to kill. Reavers that go too long without combat become irritable and quick-tempered, more than willing to take out their frustrations on their fellow crew. Most captains, for this reason, consider reavers expendable.

## THIEF-ACROBAT

While the common thief is a cut-purse and pickpocket, the thief acrobat is a highly trained specialist in the art of housebreaking and feats of dexterity and acrobatics. As an adventurer, they are masters of negotiating difficult terrain and situations with flair and panache. Masters of athletics and gymnastics, they hone their art to a level that seems to be magical to the uninitiated. Most use these skills to gain the easy score or poorly defended hoard, but some take up the life of an adventurer as a chance to test their purely mortals skills against the world full of magic and supernatural creatures.

While there may be individual thief¬acrobats found in any city across Oerik, the thief-acrobats of the City of Greyhawk are renowned across the Flanaess. They consider themselves to be an elite caste within the Thieves’ Guild.

### NATURAL GYMNAST

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement, you have advantage on Acronbatics checks for balance and you have proficiency with the grappling hook.

In addition, if holding a pole, spear, pike, quarterstaff, or other pole-like object in both hands, you can add twice your reach to your final distance moved during a long jump and the distance covered is not restricted to the thief-acrobat’s movement rate.

### AERIAL ARTISTRY

Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to move with incredible speed, precision, and power. Few obstacles can prevent you from reaching your destination.

When you move, you can instead take two short movements by flying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a creature, solid object, or ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends.

### FEARLESS AERIALIST

Starting at 9th level, you no longer take damage from falling and you no longer require a Dexterity (Acrobatics) roll to maintain your balance under normal conditions. If conditions are poor, like crossing a tightrope in a strong wind for example, you make Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks with advantage.

“Normal conditions” allows ascent up a rope, beam or ledge of about a 45” angle (maximum) or descent at a slightly steeper angle, all while upright and with hands free (in general). This is accomplished by balance, muscle coordination, and superb reflexes.

### UNCHAINED AGILITY

At 13th level, your agility, speed, and flexibility allow you to escape from almost any danger. You gain the benefits of being under a Freedom of Movement spell at all times.

### AERIAL MASTERY

At 17th level, your Aerial Artistry feature improves. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet and when you move, you can instead take 4 short movements by flying.

advantage to spot or disarm all traps of the same type in the same building or dungeon. For example, if you spot and disable a hidden pit in the Caves of Chaos, you have advantage to detect all further hidden pits in the same dungeon.

with your eyes closed while thinking of how you will spend your share of the loot. You have also learned how to set off traps. You can activate a pitfall with the simple toss of a stone, catching your enemies in the effects. While you don't have the knack for larceny other rogues possess, your mechanical expertise makes for a constant demand for your services among adventuring parties.

Troubleshooters are among of the more openly accepted kinds of rogue, and their numbers can be found almost anywhere. While some of them turn to burglary to earn their keep, most troubleshooters are adventurers. Every race has troubleshooters in their numbers; dwarves and gnomes primarily use their mechanical aptitude to disarm the ancient traps found in lost tombs or forgotten temples. Even the elves and hin have those of their race that love to tinker with the various mechanisms they come across. Troubleshooters are in high demand among adventuring parties, especially when the party is facing dungeons known to be heavily trapped. Troubleshooters arc sometimes used by local law enforcement when they have to raid a local thieves guild, or wizard's tower they know will be rigged with all sorts of

### Eye For Trouble

You are a trapsmith extraordinaire, and you are already very good at what you do. Starting at 3rd level, your proficiency bonus with Perception or Thieves Tools is doubled when making an ability check to spot or disarm a trap.

### Steady Hands

At this point, you can disassemble a trap with your eyes closed, one hand tied behind your back, and while singing a dirty sea shanty. Which you often do to mess with your companions. When you reach 9 th level and use your Thieves Tool to disable a trap, if you roll less than 15 on the die roll, treat it as if you had rolled a 15.

### Booby Trap

You have learned that traps can be used offensively if you can set them off when you need to. At 13th level, you can trigger traps up to 30 feet away if you know where precisely the trap's trigger mechanism is. This requires you to spend an action and strike the trap with a ranged attack to set it off. Anyone in the area affected by the trap must save normally or be affected by the trap.

### Roll With It

At 17th level, if a trap is set off within 30 feet of you, as a reaction, you can make a full move before the trap's effects are applied. If you are now outside of the trap's area of effect, youavoidany ill effects.

## VARIANT DUELIST

Possessing exceptional speed, nerve, and skill at arms, duelists are expert combatants. Both blade and pistol are their forte, and they must be supremely skilled with one or both to defeat their opponents.

For many, the code duello is simply a way of life. More than one military officer and aristocrat has turned to dueling to settle personal scores and public disputes, and some professional duelists make their living by serving as stand-ins for such important personages. Duelists who continue to win duels for their noble patrons can earn both fame and wealth for their endeavors. In many nations, underground fighting circuits offer duelists a chance to ply their trade, but the more conventionally minded find that their skills are always in demand among those who need capable bodyguards or skilled mercenaries.

### DANCE OF DEATH

## YAKUZA

While the Greyhawk thieves’ guild has a reputation for its power over the City and domain of Greyhawk, they pale in comparison to the reach and power of the Yakuza across western Oerik. A yakuza is many different things, depending on who is asked. He has been called a protector of the common man, thug, extortionist, rowdy, thief, mercenary, jack-of-all-trades, and even an unofficial police force in places like Minyeo, Wunan and the Suhfeng Marches. They are simultaneously despised and respected, sometimes even supported by the local daimyo. On one hand, they represent the shadowy underworld, directing and controlling illegal activities. On the other hand, they provide protection for the helpless and watch over those under their care. Of course, such paternal care has a price, and it is from this that the yakuza makes his living.

The family of a yakuza is not your natural family. Upon becoming a yakuza, you are adopted into a yakuza kumi or organisation of yakuzas. This arrangement is identical to a normal family clan. There is a family head (oyabun rather than daimyo), other kumi members hold honorifics like uncle, aunt, fathers, or sister. You are expected to treat these members as if they were blood relations, and indeed some of them

### INFORMATION BROKER

You are an information broker and can dig up all sorts of useful information through discreet inquiries—gain the floorplans of a residence, learn where a lord conceals a particular item, obtain the guards’ schedule at a daimyo’s palace, learn who stole a particular item, obtain the identity of a police informer, find a shady merchant willing to buy stolen goods, etc. At 3rd level, you become proficient in Investigation, if if you are not already.

In addition, to be successful, the yakuza quickly learns to master the art of dealing with others. When you select this archtype at 3rd level, you have advantage on Charisma ability checks as well as related skill checks.

### BODY ART

Yakuza have many traditions and observances and perhaps the best known is their use of ritual tattooing. These tattoos are not only symbols of a yakuza’s affiliations and personal accomplishments but they also provide supernatural abilities. Starting at 3rd level, you gain the benefits of two Common magical tattoos as detailed on page 118 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything. These magical tattoo do not count against the number of magical items to which you may attune.

### RITUAL INK

Your yakuza connections grant you additional magical tattoos. Starting 9th level, you gain the benefits of two additional Common or Uncommon magical tattoos or one Rare magical tattoo as detailed on page 118 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything. These magical tattoos do not count against the number of magical items to which you may attune.

### INDELIBLE POWER

The artwork covering your body continues to expand. Starting 13th level, you gain the benefits of two additional Uncommon or Rare magical tattoos and one Very Rare magical tattoos detailed page of

Cauldron Everything. These magical tattoos do not count against the number of magical items to which you may attune.

### INK MASTER

Your story as a master yakuza now covers nearly your entire body. Starting 17th level, you gain the benefits of two additional Rare or Very Rare magical tattoos and one Legendary magical tattoo as detailed on page 118 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything. These magical tattoos do not count against the number of magical items to which you may attune.

## ROGUE OPTIONAL FEATURES

A rogue has access to the following features.

**Weapon proficiencies:** dagger, club, staff, light crossbow, hand crossbow, short sword, longbow, rapier, scimitar

The following variant features can be added to those granted by rogue class. Most don't require any other changes, but some replace an existing feature, as noted at the end of the feature description. If a feature does not specify a certain level, you gain it at 1st level.

### EXTREME EFFORT

Optional 1st level rogue feature

When you make an ability check and dislike the result, you can spend a Hit Die to try to improve your check result. You do not regain any hit points from spending a Hit Die in this way, but you roll the Hit Die and add the number rolled to the result of your ability check.

### MASTER OF DISGUISE

Variant 1st level rogue feature (replace proficiency with thieve’s tools)

You gain proficiency with disguise kits, and with your choice of one of the following: forgery kits, jeweler's tools, leatherworker's tools, or weaver's tools. In addition, you make ability checks to use disguise kits normally regardless of your ability to see, even if the area you are in is heavily or lightly obscured.

(This replaces a 1st-level rogue's proficiency with thieves' tools.)

### BLUNT FORCE

1st-level rogue optional feature (adds to Sneak Attack)

Your Sneak Attack can be used on attacks made with any simple melee weapon that you are wielding in one hand.

### CANNY QUICKSTEP

5th-level rogue optional feature (alternative to Uncanny Dodge)

After an attack hits or misses you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### EXTRA ATTACK

5th-level rogue optional feature

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### QUICK CHANGE

At 6th level, you gain a new use for the bonus action provided by your Cunning Action feature. You have a number of pre-made disguises or specialty outfits, known as looks, equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus. Due to hours of practice, when you put on one of these looks, you may do so immediately, using the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action. You can also give someone else one of your prepared looks, though doing so takes 1 minute instead of just 1 bonus action. Putting on a prepared look can give you the fabulous air of a noble at a ball, the extravagant beauty of a celebrated stage performer, or the humble anonymity of a workaday commoner.

A look that functions as a disguise is nearly perfect if properly applied. Such disguises are generally not based on an individual, but are invented identities based on a general type (a local lord, a helmed member of the Town Watch, a wealthy merchant bearing expensive pigments from distant lands, etc.). If you wish to create a look that is a specialty disguise based on a specific person, you must observe that person for 8 hours.

When your proficiency bonus increases, you automatically gain a new look. However, if you wish to replace one of your existing looks, doing so takes 8 hours.

(A rogue with this variant feature only gains the benefits of Expertise with one additional proficiency at 6th level, instead of two.)

### MENTAL GYMNASTICS

15th-level rogue optional feature (enhances Slippery Mind)

If you are already proficient in Wisdom saving throws when you gain the Slippery Mind feature, you instead gain proficiency in Charisma saves.

Additionally, you are immune to being charmed, and your thoughts can’t be read by magic or other means unless you allow it.

## ROGUISH ARCHETYPE IMPROVEMENTS

The following features add to or modify certain subclass features for this class.

### FIRST STRIKE

3rd-level Assassin optional feature (enhances Assassinate)

If you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your first turn of combat, you can choose to make the hit a critical hit. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
