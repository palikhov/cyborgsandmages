# Introduction

Good news! If you've run fifth edition, then you already understand how to use most of the creatures in this book. You may see a few unfamiliar details, but fear not: this introduction covers everything that's new, and the tweaks we made to creature stat blocks don't take much time at all to grok.

Beyond this introduction, this book is organized into four chapters:

***Chapter 1: Creatures*.** The bulk of this book contains the MCDM version of classic fantasy creatures like griffons and goblins, along with new creatures of our own design, like mournlings and valok.

***Chapter 2: Environments*.** The eight environments in this book present even more creatures! These are found in specific adventuring environments, like ruined keeps and sewers. Most environments also suggest traits and lair actions you can add to existing creatures.

***Chapter 3: Villain Parties*.** Challenge the player characters with a party of your own! Each of the seven villain parties has five NPCs with their own stories and unique stat blocks.

***Chapter 4: New Psionic Powers*.** If a player in your game has a talent character who uses the rules in *The Talent and Psionics* from MCDM, they can learn new powers from the psionic creatures in this book. You can find out more about *The Talent and Psionics* at [http://mcdm.gg/talent](mcdm.gg/talent).

## New Rules and Styles

The creatures in this book generally follow the core rules, but we've made a few tweaks. These new rules and presentation styles are designed to make combat encounters easier to run, more fun, and more memorable.

### Allies and Enemies

The effects in this book sometimes target just allies or enemies. A creature is your **ally** if they're inclined to help you or fight alongside you—or if you believe they're inclined to do so. However, you are not your own ally, so if you target your allies with an effect, it doesn't affect you. A creature is your **enemy** if they're inclined to oppose you or fight against you—or if you either believe they're inclined to do so, or you plan to pick a fight with them regardless. If in doubt, it's up to the GM to decide whether a creature counts as an ally, an enemy, or neither.

### Challenge Rating

Each creature's stat block lists their challenge rating in the top right corner. The more obvious placement of the challenge rating makes it easier to find stat blocks and build encounters to challenge your players.

### Conditions

Some of the creatures in this book inflict—or are immune to—the following new conditions.

Dazed

Flanked

### Creature Roles

Each creature has a role listed next to their challenge rating. Roles are descriptive and most don't follow special rules—they simply help you build encounters and use the creature effectively in combat.

#### Ambusher

Ambushers are creatures who hide well—not just before an encounter, but during it. They utilize surprise and stealth to gain the upper hand.

#### Artillery

Artillery creatures fight best from afar. Whether they wield arrows or magical rays, these creatures always try to keep a distance from their foes.

#### Brute

Brutes are hardy creatures who have lots of hit points and deal lots of damage. They might not be the most disciplined warriors, but they make up for it with sheer toughness and aggression.

#### Companion

Companion creatures are meant to accompany player characters on adventures. For more information, see the "Companion Creatures" section.

#### Controller

Controllers debuff, move, and obstruct their enemies. They often have crowd-control actions that apply a debilitating effect or target multiple creatures at once.

#### Leader

A leader is an action-oriented creature who fights alongside underlings. For more information, see the "Action-Oriented Creatures" section.

#### Minion

Minions are weak creatures who find strength in numbers. For more information, see the "Minions" section.

#### Retainer

Retainers are sapient beings meant to accompany player characters on adventures. For more information, see the "Retainers" section.

#### Skirmisher

Skirmishers are mobile warriors who use hit-and-run tactics in combat. Their traits allow them to make the most of their position.

#### Soldier

Soldiers are well-armored creatures who draw the attacks of their foes, freeing allies to move around the battlefield. These trained warriors typically have higher attack bonuses and AC.

#### Solo

A solo creature is an action-oriented creature who can take on the player characters on their own. For more information, see the "Action-Oriented Creatures" section.

#### Support

Support creatures aid their allies, providing buffs, healing, movement, or action options.

### Mundane and Supernatural

This book uses the term **mundane** to refer to attacks, items, and other effects that aren't magical or psionic.

On the other hand, the term **supernatural** describes an effect or item that is either magical or psionic. For instance, a creature's stat block might say they're resistant to "bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from mundane attacks." This means that when you deal them bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage using a spell, power, magic weapon, or psionic weapon, the damage is supernatural and thus the creature isn't resistant to it.

### Pronouns

The core rules often use the singular pronoun "it" to refer to a single creature. This book instead uses the singular "they" to clearly delineate between creatures and objects. Objects still use "it" as a singular pronoun.

### Psionic Powers

Some creatures have psionic powers, creating effects with sheer force of will instead of with magic. When a creature manifests a power, they create an effect that has similar rules to casting spells, with the following exceptions.

#### Not Magic

Powers don't create magical effects, so they're unaffected by features and spells like *antimagic field*, *counterspell*, and *dispel magic*. The damage from a power attack isn't magical. If a rule affects only spells or magical effects, it doesn't affect powers. However, psionic powers are supernatural, so if a rule affects supernatural effects, it does affect powers (see "Mundane and Supernatural").

#### Power Orders

Every power has an **order** that is an expression of its level of strength. Powers of the 1st order are the weakest (equivalent to cantrips in strength), and 6th-order powers are the strongest.

If a stat block feature should be considered a power, its order is noted in parentheses.

#### No Components

Powers don't have material, somatic, or verbal components.

#### Manifesting Multiple Powers

Unlike player characters, if a creature's stat block allows them to manifest a power as a bonus action, they can still manifest another power of 2nd order or higher as an action on that turn. For example, a creature who manifests the jaunt power as a bonus action can also make a 2nd-order power attack as an action. Similarly, many Multiattack actions let a creature make multiple power attacks on a turn, even though each attack is a power of its own.

#### Power Attacks as Opportunity Attacks

When an enemy's movement provokes an opportunity attack from a creature whose stat block includes a melee power attack, the creature can use their reaction to make a melee power attack against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.

#### New Powers

A character playing a talent—the class found in the MCDM supplement [https://mcdm.gg/talent](The Talent and Psionics)—can use the rules in that book to learn new powers from the creatures in *Flee, Mortals!* Powers that aren't in *The Talent and Psionics* are indicated in a creature's stat block with an asterisk (*) and provided in the "New Psionic Powers" chapter of this book.

*Converter's Note: I left these asterisks out because they were ugly and, in the contexts in which this will be used, unnecessary.*

### Save Ends Effects

Some creatures have a trait or action that, on a failed saving throw, imposes a debilitating effect for an extended duration. But sometimes a lucky foe can retry their saving throw and potentially end the effect early. In such situations, the stat block specifies "save ends at start of turn" or "save ends at end of turn."

When you see this phrase, it means any creature affected by a **save ends effect** like this can repeat the saving throw on each of their turns, ending the effect on themself early on a success. They can only make that saving throw either at the start or end of their turn, as specified in the stat block.

Here is an example of an attack with a save ends effect from the **goblin cursespitter** stat block:

**Toxic Touch (Cantrip).** *Melee  or Ranged Spell Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).

> ##### Behind the Design: Save Ends Effects
>
>Save ends effects are one way of saving space in stat blocks and making them less complex for GMs to run at the table. Much like how stat blocks just reference the poisoned condition instead of spelling its rules out each time, we didn't want to fill up the pages by repeating long sentences similar to this one: "A target poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success."
>

### Spells

Some creatures have magical actions, bonus actions, and reactions. When these features should be considered spells (for the purpose of *counterspell*, *dispel magic*, and similar effects), the spell level is noted in parentheses. If the spell requires concentration, this is also noted in parentheses. Unless otherwise noted, these spells have somatic and verbal components.

#### Casting Multiple Spells

Unlike player characters, if a creature's stat block allows them to cast a spell as a bonus action, they can still cast another spell of 1st level or higher as an action on that turn. For example, a creature who casts the *misty step* spell as a bonus action can also make a 2nd-level spell attack as an action. Similarly, many Multiattack actions let a creature make multiple spell attacks on a turn, even though each attack is a spell of its own.

#### Spell Attacks as Opportunity Attacks

When an enemy's movement provokes an opportunity attack from a creature whose stat block includes a melee spell attack, the creature can use their reaction to make a melee spell attack against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.

#### Utility Spells

In addition to combat-focused spells, some creatures can cast spells that are primarily used outside of combat. To streamline the stat blocks, these spells aren't written out in the creature's combat-oriented "Actions" section. Instead, their names are listed in a separate "Utility Spells" section at the end of the stat block. After each spell name, the casting time is indicated in superscript, as shown in the Casting Times table.

*Note that at least for the moment, there is no "Utility Spells" section in these blocks on this site. The casting times superscripts are included, however.*

#### Casting Times

| Superscript | Casting Time                                 |   |
|:-----------:|----------------------------------------------|---|
|      A      | 1 action                                     |
|      B      | 1 bonus action                               |
|      R      | 1 reaction                                   |
|      +      | Longer than 1 action (see spell description) |

For example, a spellcaster's utility spells might appear as follows:

1/day each: expeditious retreatB, mage armorA, phantom steed+

### Section Structure

In this book, creature sections begin with broad descriptions for all the creatures in that section. While not all the information is common in-character knowledge, you can share these early pages with your players if you don't mind them having a little meta-knowledge.

The creature stat blocks aren't presented until the end of each section, allowing you to share flavorful information with your players and flip fewer pages when you run a band of similar creatures.

### Unusual Needs

Stat blocks in the core rules often indicate when a creature has an unusual nature and doesn't require air, food, sleep, or water to live and function. To keep the stat blocks in this book succinct, we've omitted those traits from individual stat blocks. Instead, you can refer to the following list to determine each creature type's unusual needs (or lack thereof):

- **Construct.** Constructs don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Elemental.** Elementals don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Ooze.** Oozes don't require air or sleep.
- **Undead.** Undead don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Other Creature Types.** Unless otherwise specified, other creature types require air, food, drink, and sleep.

## Action-Oriented Creatures

The solo and leader creatures presented in this book are designed to be bosses: enemies who can take on an entire party by themselves or with a handful of underlings. Rather than simply increasing the challenge rating (an approach that often leads to underwhelming encounters), this book introduces **action-oriented creatures.**

A powerful villain needs plenty of opportunities to act and move when it's not their turn. Thus, each actionoriented creature has at least one special bonus action and reaction, as well as a special section with villain actions that let them dominate the battlefield.

These actions make the boss creatures dynamic and formidable. Whether fought as an exciting solo challenge or alongside a few easy-to-run underlings, action-oriented creatures challenge the characters with dramatic and powerful actions in combat.

### Villain Actions

Every action-oriented creature has three **villain actions** they can use after an enemy's turn. Villain actions are similar to legendary actions with the following exceptions:

- A creature can use only one villain action per round (as such, villain actions tend to be more powerful than legendary actions).
- Each villain action can only be used once during a combat encounter.

Like legendary actions, a creature can't use villain actions if incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions.

#### Choosing Villain Actions

Each trio of villain actions has a recommended round order. These abilities give the battle a logical flow and a cinematic arc:

- The first villain action is an opener, which shows the characters they're not battling a typical creature. Openers generally deal some damage, summon a lackey or three, buff the boss, debuff the characters, or move the creature into an advantageous position. They're just a taste of what's to come.
- The second villain action provides crowd control. It typically fires after the heroes have had a chance to respond once or twice, get into position, and surround the villain. This second action helps the villain regain the upper hand. Like an opener, this action comes in many flavors, but it's even more powerful than an opener.
- The third and final villain action is an ultimate move or "ult"—a showstopper the villain can use to deal a devastating blow to the characters before the end of the battle.

While every creature has a recommended order of actions, you can take villain actions in any order if it makes your fight more dramatic. You could push back a villain action if a creature is stunned or might stay alive for more than three rounds, or you could perform the recommended third action in round two after several surprise critical hits!

### Unique Creatures

Many of the action-oriented creatures in this book are unique. They typically have a specific name and backstory, though you can ignore these if you wish to use the creature's stat block in another way in your campaign. For instance, **Queen Bargnot**'s stat block could be used for any action-oriented goblin in your game.

## Companion Creatures

A **companion** is a wild ally who adventures with characters. Each companion has unique traits and actions that make them a great ally. But beware! These creatures can be difficult to control in the heat of battle and just might bite the hand that feeds. Don't fret too much, though! A companion gelatinous cube or owlbear is worth the risk of an occasional wild rampage.

### Caregiver

Every companion has a player character **caregiver** who commands the creature. The caregiver's player controls the companion most of the time during the game, though the GM can step in to take control if the companion and caregiver are separated, or if the caregiver mistreats the companion in some way.

In combat, a companion shares a turn with their caregiver and acts during the caregiver's turn. A companion can move and use their own reaction and bonus action independently. But they can take only the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions unless their caregiver uses a bonus action to command the companion to take a different action, including any of the actions noted in the companion's stat block. A companion must be able to see or hear their caregiver to receive a command. A companion can also take other actions if their caregiver is incapacitated or if the companion enters a rampage (as discussed below).

> ##### One Companion Per Group
>
>Companions are a lot of fun, but having more than one companion to manage can slow things down at the table. A companion is another member of the party, with statistics and actions to track, and additional companions can easily make combat slow to a crawl. If every player wants to get in on the companion action, it's simpler for the characters to take turns as a creature's caregiver, rather than running around adventuring with a menagerie.
>
>For characters wishing to share a companion, the companion accepts a new caregiver at the end of a short or long rest. Because a companion's proficiency bonus and hit points depend on their caregiver's level, those statistics might fluctuate if the characters in a party are different levels, reflecting that a more experienced caregiver is more adept at directing a companion.
>

#### Charmed Caregiver

A caregiver who is charmed can still command their companion, but they can't command the companion to attack a creature who charmed them.

#### Incapacitated or Absent Caregiver

If a companion's caregiver is incapacitated or dies, the GM determines who controls the companion—typically, the caregiver's player can maintain control of their companion as they take a heroic stand against the enemy.

However, in cases where a caregiver and their companion are physically separated, such as when a companion is captured, the GM might wish to take control of the companion to keep the player in suspense about the creature's fate.

#### New Caregiver

At the GM's discretion, a companion can abandon a caregiver character and choose a different willing creature as a caregiver.

### Ferocity

Companions are dangerous creatures. Though often more docile than their wild counterparts, they aren't fully domesticated. Each companion's **ferocity** is a measure of their tenacity and fury, and of how those things build in battle. As a companion's ferocity increases, they gain access to powerful new actions, but they also become more difficult for a caregiver to control.

If a companion isn't incapacitated at the start of their and their caregiver's turn, their ferocity increases by 1d4 + the number of enemies the companion can see or hear within 5 feet of them. For the purpose of increasing ferocity, a group of creatures who share a single stat block (such as a swarm of rats) counts as one creature. Ferocity increases round after round during combat, and there is no maximum to the level of ferocity a companion can gain.

> ##### Bag of Rats
>
>We can already tell that some crafty players are scheming to stuff a bag full of slightly groggy rats, then open that bag up in front of their companion to build up their ferocity during a fight. However, a too-easy target doesn't rile up a companion the way being threatened by an enemy combatant in a battle for survival does. As such, the GM makes the final decision as to what constitutes an enemy for the purpose of increasing a companion's ferocity. Likewise, in the same way a swarm of creatures is counted as a single creature for the purpose of increasing ferocity, the GM is free to determine that two or three weak creatures might count as only one creature for that purpose.
>

#### Rampage

After rolling to increase ferocity at the start of their turn, if a companion has 10 ferocity or more and isn't incapacitated, they run the risk of entering a **rampage**. The companion's caregiver can make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check (no action required) to try to stop the companion from entering a rampage. To make the check, the caregiver must not be incapacitated, and the companion must be able to see or hear the caregiver. The DC for the check equals 5 + the companion's ferocity. On a success, the companion acts normally on their turn. On a failure, or if the caregiver doesn't make the check, the companion enters a rampage.

When a companion enters a rampage, they immediately move up to their speed toward the nearest creature they can sense and attack that creature with their signature attack (see below), dealing extra damage equal to half their ferocity if the attack hits. If at least one ally and one enemy are nearest and equidistant to the companion, the caregiver's player rolls any die. On an odd number, the companion attacks an ally. On an even number, the companion attacks an enemy. The caregiver's player determines which specific equidistant ally or enemy the companion engages (and can choose their own character if they wish).

A companion who can't reach a creature to attack while in a rampage uses the Dash action to move as far as they can toward the nearest creature they can sense. If a companion can't sense any potential targets, they move as far as they can in a random direction determined by the GM, avoiding danger.

When a companion who has entered a rampage resolves their action or ends their turn, their ferocity drops to 0 and they're no longer in a rampage.

#### Reducing Ferocity

To prevent a companion from entering a dangerous rampage, a caregiver has several options at their disposal for reducing the creature's ferocity.

***Ferocity Actions.*** Each companion has three actions in their stat block that cost ferocity to use. To use one of these ferocity actions, the caregiver's character level must be equal to or greater than the ferocity action's level, and the companion must spend the necessary amount of ferocity before they use the action. If the companion doesn't have enough ferocity to spend, they can't use the action.

Ferocity actions always use the companion's action, meaning they can't be used as part of an opportunity attack. Ferocity actions can't be used while a companion is in a rampage.

***End of Combat.*** When a combat encounter involving a companion ends and the companion isn't dying, the companion regains hit points equal to their ferocity, and their ferocity drops to 0. The GM determines when a combat encounter ends, typically at the point when creatures stop acting in initiative order.

### Dying Companions

When a companion is reduced to 0 hit points, they are dying and make death saving throws just as characters do. Thus, characters always have a chance to save their furry (or scaly, or slimy, or exoskeletony) friends' lives! If combat ends while a companion is dying, their ferocity drops to 0 but they don't regain hit points (see "End of Combat" above).

### Statistics

In addition to their ferocity actions, a companion's statistics vary from the statistics of their wild counterparts. This makes a companion easier to run, keeps their power in line with other companions, and helps ensure companions never outshine the characters. As somewhat more social versions of wild creatures, companions are often cleverer and more versatile than their untamed counterparts.

#### Hit Dice

Most creatures without character classes have their Hit Die type determined by their size (d4 for Tiny creatures, d6 for Small creatures, and so forth). However, companions are special and use a d8 for Hit Dice regardless of size.

#### Language

A companion shares a unique bond with their caregiver and can understand basic commands in one language chosen by the caregiver. However, the companion can't read, speak, or write any language, even if similar creatures normally can.

#### Proficiency Bonus

Because a companion's effectiveness and survivability depend on the training and expertise of their caregiver, a companion's proficiency bonus is equal to their caregiver's proficiency bonus. Additionally, some of a companion's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as PB. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a companion's proficiency bonus; these are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a companion has a +2 proficiency bonus, PBd6 means 2d6.

#### Proficiency Bonus

Each companion has an action designated as their signature attack. A signature attack is always a melee attack, and it's typically the creature's best natural attack. A companion uses their signature attack when they enter a rampage.

Each companion also has special actions that they can use only by spending ferocity during their turn, with some of those actions making use of the companion's signature attack. See "Reducing Ferocity" above for more information on ferocity actions.

### Companion Mounts

Many companions are large enough to ride, especially by caregivers who are Small, when outfitted with an exotic saddle similar to those worn by aquatic or flying mounts. When a caregiver rides a companion into combat, not much actually changes. The caregiver and companion still each act on the same turn, and the caregiver must use their bonus action to direct the companion to take any action other than the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Under some circumstances, a companion might allow themself to be ridden by a creature other than their caregiver, though that other creature can't give the companion commands.

If a companion rampages while bearing a rider, that rider counts as being within 5 feet of the companion when determining which creature the companion attacks. If a companion attacks their rider, they have disadvantage on the attack roll.

> ##### Companion Barding
>
>At the GM's discretion, characters can purchase barding for a companion, as discussed in the core rules, with the following adjustments:
>
>- Barding for Small companions weighs half as much as the equivalent armor for Humanoids. Barding for Medium companions weighs the same as Humanoid armor, while barding for Large companions weighs four times as much.
>- Companions are proficient in any barding they wear.
>- When a companion wears barding, they don't add their caregiver's proficiency bonus to their AC.
>- Companions who are shapechangers (such as the mimic companion) can't use that ability while wearing barding.
>- Companions who have corrosive bodies or are amorphous (such as the gelatinous cube companion) can't wear nonmagical barding.

### Companion Encounter Balance

Unless a caregiver has the beastheart class (found in [https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/beastheart-companions](Beastheart and Monstrous Companions)), the GM should consider a companion as akin to a powerful combat-focused magic item when building encounters. A companion gives a party a significant power boost, not just by dishing out more damage and providing more hit points for enemies to target, but also by creating complications that can make a fight more challenging for the party's foes. GMs can adjust encounter difficulty by one step (from easy to medium, hard to deadly, and so forth) to properly challenge a group of characters with a companion, particularly if the characters' average level is 7th or lower.

### NPCs with Companions

Companion creatures are designed to accompany player characters on adventures. If an NPC has a pet or creature servant, it's recommended you use the creature's normal stat block. For instance, if an NPC ranger has an owlbear they work with, that creature would use the normal **owlbear** stat block and be played by the GM as normal. But if the characters are charged with rescuing a fallen druid NPC's owlbear pet from the clutches of a villain, the GM can choose to instead make the pet an **owlbear companion**, allowing the creature to join their rescuers on their adventures.

## Retainers

**Retainers** are sapient beings who adventure alongside the player characters. Each retainer is a less experienced adventurer who a player character can take under their wing. Retainers are never meant to achieve the same power level as the player characters.

Rules for retainers first appeared in *Strongholds & Followers*. This book contains updated rules for these followers.

### Mentor

Every retainer has a player character **mentor**. A retainer's mentor gives them orders, and the mentor's player also controls the retainer. A retainer acts on the same initiattive count as their mentor in combat, acting immediately before or after the mentor (player's choice). As a mentor gains experience and levels up, so does their retainer (see "Statistics" below).

### Statistics

Retainers are designed to be easy to run so their player (who is already managing a complex character) doesn't get overwhelmed with even more details. Each retainer has a simple stat block—though these are similar to other creature stat blocks, retainers follow a few different rules.

#### Level

A retainer's level equals their mentor's level. As a retainer levels up, their hit points increase (see "Hit Points and Hit Dice") and they gain combat features (see "Features"). Additionally, a few of their statistics increase when their mentor's proficiency bonus does, including attack bonuses, skills, and save DC (see "Proficiency Bonus"). Their other statistics typically remain the same regardless of their level.

#### Armor Class

Unlike player characters, a retainer's armor class isn't determined by a particular set of armor they don (like studded leather). Instead, each retainer's armor class is simplified to one of three armor types:

- Retainers with light armor have AC 13.
- Retainers with medium armor have AC 15.
- Retainers with heavy armor have AC 18.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

Retainers gain one Hit Die per level. Their hit point maximum is based on the size of their Hit Die, as shown on the Retainer Hit Points table.

Retainers have exceptionally high hit points—sometimes even higher than their mentor. This allows the party to enjoy the presence of a beloved retainer without worrying about losing them to an unlucky roll of the dice or decision by a single player. The GM often awards characters with retainers in lieu of other treasure. Such rewards shouldn't be lost easily.

##### Retainer Hit Points
| Hit Die Size | Hit Point Maximum   |   |
|:------------:|---------------------|---|
|      d6      | 6 times their level |
|      d8      | 7 times their level |
|      d10     | 8 times their level |
|      d12     | 9 times their level |

#### Proficiency Bonus

Because a retainer's effectiveness and survivability depend on the training and expertise of their mentor, a retainer's proficiency bonus is equal to their mentor's proficiency bonus.

Some of a retainer's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as PB. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a retainer's proficiency bonus; these are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a retainer has a +3 proficiency bonus, PBd10 means 3d10.

A retainer adds their proficiency bonus to any saving throw they make.

#### Features

Each retainer has a **signature attack** they can make using the Attack action each round. Retainers can use their signature attack to make opportunity attacks, even if their signature attack isn't a melee weapon attack.

A retainer gains new features at 3rd, 5th, and 7th level. Some features can only be used a certain number of times per day (as noted in the retainer's stat block).

Additionally, if a retainer's signature attack is a weapon attack, they typically gain an extra attack at 7th level (as noted in their stat block), allowing them to make two signature attacks per round instead of one.

#### Gear

When a retainer joins the party, they typically carry clothes appropriate to their position, a suit of armor, a weapon, and an explorer's pack. If the retainer casts spells, they also carry a spellcasting implement. Any additional equipment must be provided to them by their mentor.

***Magic Items.*** Retainers can use magic items like anyone else. For example, a *+1 weapon* increases their attack and damage rolls by 1, and *+1 armor* of the appropriate type (light, medium, or heavy) increases their AC by 1.

One happy side effect of having retainers is that as a player character levels up and acquires better equipment, they can pass their obsolete items on to the retainer.

### Dying Retainers

When a retainer is reduced to 0 hit points, they follow the same rules as player characters. If not killed instantly by massive damage, they fall unconscious, make death saving throws, and can be stabilized or healed.

### Optional Rules: Shared Attacks

If a player wants to speed up their retainer's turn, they can make **shared attacks** at the GM's discretion.

When the mentor hits a creature with an attack, if their retainer can see or hear them, the retainer is inspired by their mentor's success. On the inspired retainer's next turn, for each successful attack their mentor just made, the retainer can automatically hit a creature of their choice within range with their signature attack, up to the number of attacks the retainer can make.

If the mentor hit with fewer attacks than the numberof attacks the retainer can make, the retainer can make  additional attack rolls for those attacks to see if they hit.

### Retainer Encounter Balance

When building encounters, the GM should consider a retainer as akin to a powerful combat-focused magic item. A retainer gives a party a significant power boost; they not only dish out more damage and provide more hit points for enemies to target, but they also create complications to challenge the party's foes. GMs can increase encounter difficulty by one step (from easy to medium, hard to deadly, and so forth) to properly challenge a group of characters with a retainer.

## Minions

A **minion** is a weak foe, designed to allow GMs to create dramatic combat encounters with hordes of enemies without overwhelming the characters. In fact, an encounter with minions makes characters feel heroic, since they can take on a myriad of foes and live to tell the tale.

However, minions still make threatening foes. Killing a minion still requires penetrating their defenses, and characters can't just shrug off damage from minion attacks.

So how do minions make running a horde of enemies quick and easy for the GM?

- Minions are simple to run. Their stat blocks are small and uncomplicated.
- Minions act quickly. They don't multiattack, roll for damage, or take unique bonus actions or reactions, so their turns aren't long.
- Minions die fast. A character can kill several minions with a single weapon attack!
- Minions have strength in numbers. Their attacks can be grouped together to make them deadlier and faster to use at the table.

### No Hit Dice

Minions have hit points but no Hit Dice, simplifying their design. Minions can't spend Hit Dice to heal during a short rest because they have none.

### No Damage Rolls

Minions don't roll for damage because their attacks deal a static amount of damage. They also can't score critical hits.

### Shared Turns

Typically, all minions of the same stat block act on the same turn. Since they share a turn, the minions can each move into position then each use an action if they wish, instead of each moving and taking an action individually.

### Minion Trait

Every minion has the Minion trait, which affects the creature in the following ways:

- If the minion takes any damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0.
- If the minion takes damage from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum; otherwise they take no damage.

### Overkill Attacks

Powerful weapon attacks can kill more than one minion in a single maneuver called an **overkill attack.**

As already discussed, a weapon attack requires only 1 point of damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, regardless of their hit point maximum. However, when a weapon attack's damage does exceed the target minion's hit point maximum, the attack becomes an overkill attack and the damage dealt beyond the minion's hit point maximum becomes **overkill damage.**

Overkill damage can be applied to a second minion who has the same stat block as the target and is in overkill range (see below). Damage against the second minion is counted as if you made a weapon attack against them; since it only takes 1 point of weapon damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, any amount of overkill damage immediately knocks them out. But wait, it gets better—if the initial attack's overkill damage exceeds the second minion's hit point maximum, the leftover overkill damage can roll over to a third minion, and so on! In other words, for each time the overkill damage exceeds the new target's hit point maximum, the attacker can choose an additional minion to reduce to 0 hit points.

For example, when a weapon attack deals 18 damage to a minion with a hit point maximum of 5, the overkill damage is 13. If there are three additional minions of the same stat block in overkill range, they can all three be immediately reduced to 0 hit points, since the overkill damage exceeded the target's hit point maximum more than twice over.

Overkill attacks can't be made as part of an opportunity attack.

### Overkill Range

Minions must be within a certain range to qualify for an overkill attack, determined by whether the attack is a melee or ranged attack. In addition to the examples below, the "Overkill Damage Illustrated" sidebar demonstrates how to calculate overkill damage.

#### Melee Overkill Attacks

When a creature hits a minion with a melee weapon attack, other minions within reach of the attack are in **overkill range** and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the weapon attack's reach.

*Lady Ulnock the paladin battles a horde of goblin minions (each with 6 hit points). She hits a goblin minion with her longsword and uses Divine Smite, dealing 8 slashing damage and 11 radiant damage to the target for a total of 19 damage. Since Lady Ulnock dealt 13 points of overkill damage—more than the hit point maximum of two additional minions—she can choose up to three additional goblin minions within 5 feet of her (the reach of her longsword attack) and reduce them to 0 hit points. If there are no other goblin minions within 5 feet of Lady Ulnock, she can't damage additional minions with this attack.*

#### Ranged Overkill Attacks

When a creature hits a minion with a ranged weapon attack, other minions in a line originating from the creature in the direction of the target, to a distance equal to the weapon's short range, are in **overkill range** and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the line or beyond the weapon's short range.

*Perigold Quickfingers the rogue is hidden and takes aim at a group of zombie minions (each with 6 hit points) with his light crossbow (which has a short range of 80 feet). He hits a zombie minion with his crossbow, dealing extra damage thanks to his Sneak Attack, for a total of 14 damage. Since Perigold dealt 8 points of overkill damage—more than the hit point maximum of one additional minion—he can choose up to two additional zombie minions in an 80-foot-long line extending from Perigold in the direction of the target, reducing them to 0 hit points. If there are no other zombie minions in the line, then Perigold can't damage other minions with this attack.*

> ##### Behind the Design: Minion Trait
>
>You might ask, why not just give minions 1 hit point and take no damage when they save for half, like in fourth edition? First, spells that use a creature's hit points to determine effectiveness—like *color spray* and *sleep*—would devastate all minions, even those meant to challenge high-level characters. These spells are still effective againstminions, just not devastating!
>
>Second, spells and effects that deal damage without any attack roll or save—like *magic missile* and *spike growth*—would lay waste to minions with 1 hit point. This fits the fiction for minions with low challenge ratings, like goblins and zombies. But the balance of combat and fiction breaks down to near-silliness at higher levels when the same spells easily take down powerful devil minions.
>
>Finally, high-level spells with a save for half damage—like *fireball* or *meteor swarm*—would feel wasted against minions with 1 hit point. Why use a higher-level spell when a lower-level one will do? Similarly, the fourth edition design could lead to a kobold minion illogically surviving a fireball spell while a "stronger" standard kobold next to them dies, despite both creatures succeeding on their saving throw. By contrast, under this book's minion rules, spellcasters still have a good reason to use high-level spells against minions.

> ##### Overkill Damage Illustrated
>
>Imagine a fighter is making a melee attack with a shortsword against a lackey, and two more lackeys are within overkill range of that attack. Each lackey is a minion with 6 hit points. In example A, the attack hits and deals 4 piercing damage. This kills only the targeted lackey. A successful attack against a minion always kills the target.
>
>In example B, the attack is a critical hit and deals 13 piercing damage. This kills the targeted lackey with 7 overkill damage remaining, which spreads to the other minions within the fighter's overkill range. So a second lackey within 5 feet of the fighter takes 6 piercing damage and dies, leaving 1 overkill damage remaining. The third lackey takes that last point of overkill damage and dies.
>

### Group Attacks

Each minion has at least one group attack action that speeds up play. In a group attack, two to five minions of the same stat block who share a turn can all use their action to join the attack, provided the target is within the original attack's reach or range for each minion.

- Make a single attack roll for the group attack. It counts as one attack.
- A group attack roll gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for each minion who joins the attack. (For example, if four goblin minions make a group attack together, the attack roll has a +4 bonus.)
- If the group attack hits, multiply the damage by the number of minions who joined that group attack. (For example, if four goblin minions hit with a group attack that deals 1 damage, their group attack deals 4 damage.)

The GM decides how many minions join a group attack. For instance, if five minions surround a target, the GM may decide to have all five attack at once to speed up combat, or may break up the attacks among smaller groups to increase the odds that some minions hit while others miss. A single minion can even use their group attack action on their own—they make the attack as a normal creature would, and simply don't benefit from the group bonuses described above.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage

A group attack is only made with advantage or disadvantage if all the minions joining the group attack have advantage or disadvantage on the attack roll. Otherwise, the attack is made without advantage or disadvantage.

#### Cover and Concealment

If a target has cover or concealment from some but not all minions, the GM should divide the minions into multiple groups based on the type of cover or concealment they have, then make a separate attack for each group.

#### Target Response Effects

If a group attack triggers a reaction or similar effect that would normally affect a single attacker, such as the *fire shield* or *hellish rebuke* spell, the target of the group attack picks one minion who joined the attack to be affected by the effect.

#### Group Opportunity Attacks

If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from more than one minion of the same stat block at a time and those minions have a melee group attack action, the minions can each use their reaction to join a group attack as an opportunity attack.

### Optional Rule: Group Saving Throws

Though minions often make saving throws individually, there are times when rolling individual saving throws for each minion could slow down the fight, like when a cleric surrounded by eighteen shade minions uses Turn Undead.

When many minions with the same stat block need to make a saving throw against the same effect at the same time, you can make one saving throw for a group of up to five minions at a time. All minions in a group use the result of the saving throw.

For instance, if thirty-four goblin minions need to make a saving throw against a hypnotic pattern spell, the minions would make a total of seven saving throws against the spell: six for thirty minions divided into six groups of five, and one more save for the remaining group of four minions.

### Optional Rule: Tough Minions

Minions of a higher challenge rating, such as abyssal ghouls or fire giants, make for powerful foes. Consequently, it could break the game's verisimilitude for an NPC commoner to kill such a minion with a single attack. To keep minions believable, you can use the following rule.

When a minion's challenge rating is at least 6 higher than an NPC's challenge rating, that NPC's actions and traits affect a minion as if they didn't have the Minion trait, reducing the minion's hit points like a normal creature instead of automatically dropping them to 0.

This rule shouldn't be applied to player characters—they're heroes who can always kill a minion in one hit.

### Special Traits

Many minions have traits that give them strength in numbers but become less powerful as their allies are defeated. For example, an enemy who starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more goblin lackeys must succeed on a saving throw or take damage from the lackeys' Tiny Stabs trait.

### Challenge Ratings

Minions have a challenge rating just like any other creature. However, their experience point value depends on their challenge rating, as shown on the Minion Encounter Building table. Aside from their damage output, the Minion trait, and their experience point value, a minion's statistics are on par with a standard creature of the same challenge rating.

When the rules reference a challenge rating, such as the *polymorph* spell or the cleric's Destroy Undead feature, use the minion's listed challenge rating as normal. For instance, a 5th-level cleric can affect Undead creatures with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower with their Destroy Undead feature—so this feature can affect rotting zombie minions (CR 1/4) but not shade minions (CR 1).

### Building Minion Encounters

Minions present opportunities for memorable, cinematic encounters. Keep the following tips in mind to achieve maximum fun while planning and running combat encounters with minions.

#### Encounter Difficulty

When building encounters against a single foe, the core rules advise matching the characters with a creature whose challenge rating (CR) is close to the average party level. What happens when you add minions to the mix?

You can use the Minion Encounter Building table to determine how many minions are equivalent to one standard creature of that CR for encounter building.

You can increase a minion's challenge rating using the rules in the "Modifying and Making Minions" section.

#### Tell Your Players

While it's tempting to pit your unsuspecting players against a horde of fire giants just to watch their eyes pop out of their faces in surprise, minion encounters are more fun overall if you share the rules for minions with your players before they get into an encounter. They'll understand how overkill and group attacks work, spend their resources more efficiently, and be able to help you track the fight more easily, which is worth a lot more than the shock value of a sea of foes the players don't know are minions.

If you want the best of both worlds, end a session with the characters confronting a horde of creatures before rolling initiative. At the start of the next session, reveal those creatures are minions and share the rules.

|  30 | 15,500 |          10          |

#### Not Too Many

When you're planning your encounters, think of five minions as one standard creature. While it might be exciting to throw a hundred minions at the characters, that's like them facing twenty standard creatures. It can be done and might even be fun, but it's not the typical minion experience and results in a much longer battle than normal. Keep the following tips in mind when adding minions to an encounter:

- When the characters are 10th level or lower, most encounters work well with ten to twenty minions in addition to other creatures.
- When the characters are 11th level or higher, they're more efficient at killing minions, and many of the poor critters will die before even acting. Most high-level encounters work well with twenty to thirty minions.
- If you find midbattle that minions are dying too quickly to present a challenge, you can have reinforcements join the fray.
- Though too many minions can cause a problem, you don't want too few either. If you're using minions in your encounter, plan to include at least enough minions to count as one standard creature, as shown on the Minion Encounter Building table. You won't break anything if you include fewer—the encounter just isn't likely to be as satisfying.

#### Add Standard Creatures

Minion encounters become more dynamic if you add some standard creatures allied with the minions. A hag coven surrounded by ogre minions or a red dragon tyrant commanding fire giant minions present more interesting encounters than copies of the same enemy, challenging the characters to use diverse tactics.

> ##### Minion Bands
>
>A combat encounter with more than five minions per character can become deadly if all minions act on the same turn—the characters cut down minion hordes on their turns but then suffer massive damage as a sea of minions pour down on them. While many groups like this challenge, you have the option to divide the minions into different bands that act on different initiative counts. If you do this, minions can only join group attacks with minions in the same band. At the start of a new round, two or more bands of minions can reorganize into one band, acting on the lowest initiative count of the bands that combined.
>
>If you divide minions into bands, be sure to distinguish which minions belong together. For gridded combat, you could use a colored marker for each miniature. In a theater of the mind encounter, try group descriptors like "zombie dwarves" and "zombie elves."
>

#### Cut the Choke Points

Since minions are most effective in numbers, avoid encounters in cramped dungeon tunnels and similar choke points. Combat becomes dull in tight quarters if only a couple minions can attack at a time.

### Modifying and Making Minions

You can increase a minion's challenge rating or create new minions using the Minion Statistics by Challenge Rating table. To change an existing minion's challenge rating, adjust their proficiency bonus, hit points, and damage dealt by their attacks. If a minion's proficiency bonus changes, their AC, ability modifiers, attack bonuses, and the DC for ability checks and saving throws made to resist the minion's traits and actions have the same adjustments. For example, if the minion's proficiency bonus increases by 1, so do their AC, ability modifiers, attack bonuses, and DCs.

If you're using the table to create a new minion, you can lift statistics directly from the table. If the minion doesn't wear armor and their AC is less than 10 plus their proficiency modifier, consider giving the creature natural armor that grants a bonus to AC equal to their proficiency bonus.

The table is merely a guide—feel free to tweak the math to get the specific minion you desire.

##### Minion Statistics by Challenge Rating
|  CR | Prof. Bonus | Hit Points | Damage |   |
|:---:|:-----------:|:----------:|:------:|---|
|  0  |      +2     |     ≤ 4    |    1   |

## The Timescape

The places, people, and other proper names in the lore of this book come from the timescape, the MCDM multiverse. Most of the creatures detailed in this book are found in Orden, a world of high fantasy and just one of the timescape's many planes (also called manifolds). Orden is also called the Mundane World. If you like what you're reading, you can find more lore about the timescape on the MCDM Patreon at [http://mcdm.gg/patreon](mcdm.gg/patreon).

You can ignore any creature's lore if you wish to use their stat block in another way in your campaign.

## Using Creature Roles

Creature roles help you build interesting encounters with varied challenges. While including every role in a combat encounter makes the battle too complicated for most groups, a fight with creatures who are all the same role typically leads to dull, grindy combat—and few players (or GMs) enjoy combat where both sides are just standing still and rolling to hit without anything dynamic or dramatic happening. For instance, an encounter with a controller, a skirmisher, and two soldiers is more interesting and fun than an encounter with four soldiers.

### Ambusher Creatures

Ambusher creatures can hide, become invisible, or otherwise disappear from sight on their turns. They typically spend half their turn attacking a player character, and the other half slipping away and hiding. They focus on taking down a single character, sometimes dragging their target into the place where they hide.

Encounters that include ambushers should have plenty of cover, giving them places to hide. Adding other creatures—typically brutes, minions, skirmishers, or soldiers—keeps other player characters busy while the ambusher focuses on taking down a single target.

### Artillery Creatures

Artillery creatures are great at ranged combat and can damage player characters who typically hang back behind beefier counterparts. Most artillery creatures are weak in melee, so add some brutes, minions, or soldiers for them to hide behind during combat.

On their turn in combat, an artillery creature typically tries to move away from any foes within 30 feet, puts a brute, soldier, or other ally between themself and the threat, then attacks that enemy. If forced into melee, most artillery creatures do whatever they can to get away, including using the Dash or Disengage action. If no enemies are closing in, artillery creatures move to keep the player characters at the edge of their range and often attack the biggest threat to their allies first.

### Brute Creatures

Brute creatures hit hard and have a lot of hit points. Their damage output can't be ignored, so player characters often focus on taking down brutes instead of other creatures who have fewer hit points or are weaker in melee. Brutes need to get up close to perform their most devastating attacks, so they work best on smaller battlefields. On their turn in combat, brutes move toward the closest group of enemies and attack, preferring to engage multiple foes at once. Brutes tend to be simpler to run than other creatures, so you can include a lot of them in an encounter.

### Controller Creatures

With their ability to debuff, hamper, and move player characters, controllers make a dynamic addition to any battle. They tend to have more complicated actions and traits with unique effects, so most combat encounters shouldn't have more than one or two controllers.

Many controllers work best when they have brutes, minions, skirmishers, and soldiers protecting them and taking advantage of the effects they create. Controllers often use their biggest and most powerful effects at the start of an encounter, affecting as many foes as possible. If the controller can't affect multiple characters or use their most powerful feature, they focus on manipulating the battlefield and repositioning so they can use that feature on their next turn.

### Leader and Support Creatures

Leader creatures are action oriented (see "Action-Oriented Creatures") and fight best alongside allies. Support creatures function much like leaders, but they lack villain actions and are less complex.

Leader and support creatures can summon reinforcements, buff their allies, and grant allies extra movement and actions. As long as a leader or support creature stays in the fight, their allies are enhanced. They are most effective when protected by and buffing artillery, brutes, minions, skirmishers, and soldiers. You typically shouldn't use more than one leader or support creature in an encounter, as their overlapping enhancements can turn a seemingly normal encounter into a fatal one.

Leaders and support creatures remain close to their allies so their features can benefit as many creatures as possible.

### Minion Creatures

As discussed in the "Minions" section, minions allow you to create cinematic battles where the characters feel heroic as they cut through several foes at a time. Using minions of a challenge rating within 2 of the characters' average level also keeps them dangerous and relevant. When minions work together, they can't be ignored, as they deal a lot of damage and can lock down the characters. Minions make excellent protectors for ambushers, artillery, controllers, and leaders.

### Skirmisher Creatures

Skirmisher creatures make battles dynamic. They can move to attack vulnerable player characters who are weaker in melee, then retreat (if they can do so safely) to protect their artillery, controller, leader, and support allies. Since they can outrun and outmaneuver player characters, this forces the heroes to act tactically. Skirmishers pair well with each other creature role, including other skirmishers.

### Soldier Creatures

Soldier creatures defend their allies by drawing the player characters' attacks. They make excellent protectors for ambushers, artillery creatures, controllers, leaders, and support creatures. Soldiers don't need to stay very close to the creatures they protect—and it's better if they don't. A soldier who breaks away from their charge can lock down a threat far from the rest of the fight.

During combat, soldiers engage characters who are strong in melee. A soldier battles as many foes as they can reach so their allies can freely move. If more than one soldier is in a battle, they typically split up, each fighting  different character.

### Solo Creatures

Solo creatures are action-oriented (see "Action-Oriented Creatures"). Their villain actions and lair actions allow them to hamper and harm foes outside of the normal turn order. They're encountered alone and fight most effectively in environments with plenty of space to move around and find cover.

Solo creatures use every movement advantage they have, burrowing, climbing, flying, swimming, or teleporting around the battlefield on their turn. They focus on the character threatening them most, but also position themselves to target as many foes as possible with their area-of-effect features.

## Encounter Building

Building combat encounters using the game's core rules is complex, time-consuming, and doesn't work for the play style of many groups. The core rules state that most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight mediumdifficulty encounters per adventuring day. This is good advice for classic dungeon crawls, but in adventures that fit more into the heroic fantasy genre, player characters rarely face more than three or four encounters before settling down for a long rest. When GMs use the core guidelines for such adventures, heroes often aren't pushed to satisfying limits—especially at higher levels where their daily resources are vast.

The guidance in this section presents a more flexible way of planning a challenging (but survivable) adventuring day. It replaces the advice in the core rules and allows you to better dial in the challenge of an encounter with less preparation time.

### Encounters per Day

An adventuring day is the time between the end of one long rest to the end of the next. How many combat encounters should adventurers face between those long rests? The answer really depends on how difficult the combat encounters are. To help plan encounters, each level of encounter difficulty has a daily encounter points rating. See "Step 1: Choose Encounter Difficulty" for each difficulty's rating.

To give the characters a good but survivable challenge, fill each adventuring day with encounters that total 6 to 8 points over the course of the day. Here are some examples of daily encounter combinations:

- Two easy encounters (1 point each), one standard encounter (2 points), and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 8 points
- Three easy encounters (1 point each) and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 7 points
- Three standard encounters (2 points each), for a total of 6 points
- Two standard encounters (2 points each) and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 8 points
- Two hard encounters (4 points each), for a total of 8 points

The daily encounter budgets have been calibrated so it's likely a party will run out of resources but survive the adventuring day. If you want a more challenging adventure day that doesn't ensure a party's survival, give yourself a daily encounter points budget of 12 points.

### Step 1: Choose Encounter Difficulty

Begin building your encounter by determining how difficult you want the threat to be. This section provides guidance on choosing an encounter difficulty and how many daily encounter points each encounter is worth.

Though this section uses familiar language regarding encounter difficulty, the meanings of these terms don't align perfectly with the core rules. For instance, for parties of 5th level and beyond, the core rules might call an encounter "hard," but under our guidelines the encounter is standard or even easy. And some "deadly" encounters in the core rules are merely hard encounters under our guidelines. These differences account for fewer encounters in a day.

#### Easier than Easy: Trivial Encounters

Trivial encounters require barely any effort on the part of the characters—like a group of 20th-level heroes taking on a handful of crawling claws or goblins. The characters are guaranteed to survive the fight and won't spend many resources. These encounters can be fun to occasionally throw into your game, but for many groups, the novelty disappears quickly. Too many trivial encounters can feel like a waste of time.

A trivial encounter is worth 0 daily encounter points.

#### Easy Encounters (1 Point)

Unless the characters have already depleted many of their resources and hit points, easy encounters won't threaten their lives. Easy encounters are great for adventures that don't give the characters much time to rest or for times when you want the heroes to feel like superheroes.

An easy encounter is worth 1 daily encounter point.

#### Standard Encounters (2 Points)

Standard encounters are the most common for many adventuring groups. These battles deplete significant resources and hit points. While character death is uncommon in standard encounters, it isn't impossible, especially if a player makes a poor tactical choice or just finds the dice are against them.

A standard encounter is worth 2 daily encounter points.

#### Hard Encounters (4 Points)

Hard encounters are typically climactic encounters with bosses and their minions—or anything else that puts the characters' lives in peril. Hard encounters are winnable, but the characters need all their resources, wits, and luck to survive.

A hard encounter is worth 4 daily encounter points.

#### Extreme Encounters (8 Points)

Extreme encounters are ones where the characters will likely not survive if they try to fight to the bitter end. Such encounters rarely or never appear in most campaigns—though if the characters are level 17 or higher, they can typically survive (or come back to life after) such encounters.

An extreme encounter is worth 8 daily encounter points.

> ##### Avoiding Combat
>
>The characters might avoid combat encounters through stealth, clever negotiation, luck, or other unforeseen circumstances. You have two options when this happens. First is to let the heroes have the extra resources going into the next battle—clever thinking should be rewarded! But if your group likes to fight, you can always add another combat encounter to the adventuring day (if it fits within your daily encounter points budget).
>

### Step 2: Determine CR Budget

Once you choose the desired difficulty of your encounter, you can determine its CR budget. To do so, you'll need to know the average character level of the party (rounding down).

Using the Encounter CR per Character table, find the row that lists your party's average character level, then find the column that lists your desired encounter difficulty. The number in that intersecting cell is your CR budget *per character*—just multiply that number by the number of characters in the party, and that's your total CR budget to spend in the "Step 3: Spend CR Budget" section.

For example, if you wanted to build a hard encounter for a group of four 5th-level characters, you would multiply 2½ (from the Encounter CR per Character table) by 4 (the number of characters) to get a total CR budget of 10.

##### Encounter CR per Character
| Average Character Level | Easy | Standard | Hard | CR Cap |   |
|:-----------------------:|:----:|:--------:|:----:|:------:|---|
|           1st           | 1/8* |   1/8*   |  1/4 |    1   |
|           2nd           |  1/8 |    1/4   |  1/2 |    3   |
|           3rd           |  1/4 |    1/2   |  3/4 |    4   |
|           4th           |  1/2 |    3/4   |   1  |    6   |
|           5th           |   1  |    1½    |  2½  |    8   |
|           6th           |  1½  |     2    |   3  |    9   |
|           7th           |   2  |    2½    |  3½  |   10   |
|           8th           |  2½  |     3    |   4  |   12   |
|           9th           |   3  |    3½    |  4½  |   13   |
|           10th          |  3½  |     4    |   6  |   15   |
|           11th          |   4  |    4½    |  5½  |   16   |
|           12th          |  4½  |     5    |   6  |   17   |
|           13th          |   5  |    5½    |  6½  |   19   |
|           14th          |  5½  |     6    |   7  |   20   |
|           15th          |   6  |    6½    |  7½  |   22   |
|           16th          |  6½  |     7    |   8  |   24   |
|           17th          |   7  |    7½    |  8½  |   25   |
|           18th          |  7½  |     8    |   9  |   26   |
|           19th          |   8  |    8½    |  9½  |   28   |
|           20th          |  8½  |     9    |  10  |   30   |
*Given how low a character's hit points are at 1st level, there isn't much difference between an easy and a standard encounter

#### Companions and Retainers

For the purpose of encounter building, if the player characters adventure with one or more companions or retainers, consider them player characters but subtract 2 from their actual level. However, if a companion's caregiver is a beastheart, don't count the companion as an extra character—the beastheart and companion together have the equivalent power of one full character.

#### CR Cap

Some creatures who fit into your CR budget are too much for the characters to handle. Those monsters deal a lot of damage and create effects that are difficult to overcome for characters under a certain level. That's why the Encounter CR per Character table provides a challenge rating cap for each average character level. When you're building your encounter (see "Step 3: Spend CR Budget"), don't add any creature with a challenge rating higher than the average character level's CR cap.

#### Solo Creatures

When you use a solo creature, you shouldn't use the above encounter-building rules. Instead, refer to the CR cap for the average character level, then depending on how difficult you want the encounter to be, select one solo creature within the CR range indicated on the Solo Creatures Encounters table.

##### Solo Creature Encounters
|   Group Size   |     Trivial     |       Easy       |     Standard     |       Hard       |   |
|:--------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|---|
| 4–5 characters | CR cap minus 7+ | CR cap minus 5-6 | CR cap minus 3-4 | CR cap minus 0-2 |
| 6-7 characters | CR cap minus 6+ | CR cap minus 4-5 | CR cap minus 2-3 | CR cap minus 0-1 |

For example, a group of four 5th-level characters has a CR cap of 8. A solo creature with a challenge rating of 1 or less is a trivial encounter for them, and a solo creature with a challenge rating of 6–8 is a hard encounter for them.

***Low-CR Solo Creatures.*** The above guidance applies to most of the solo creatures in this book, but the ankheg is an exception—CR scales differently at low levels, and at CR 2, the ankheg has the lowest CR of any solo monster in this book. If a party has four or five characters, you can pit the ankheg (or another solo creature of CR 4 or below) against a party that's one level lower than indicated by the Solo Creature Encounters table. If a party has six or seven characters, you can pit the ankheg against a party that's two levels lower than indicated by that table.

### Step 3: Spend CR Budget

Now that you have your CR budget, spend it! Select creatures you want to use in the encounter and add their challenge ratings together until you get as close as you can to your CR budget. Here are some things to keep in mind:

- If you're building a hard encounter, don't go over your budget (unless you want to create an extreme encounter).
- If you're building an easy encounter, don't go under your budget (unless you want to create a trivial encounter).
- Remember that when encounter building, minions don't count as a full creature. Refer to the Minion Encounter Building table (in the "Minions" section) to determine how many minions count as one creature of their CR.
- You typically shouldn't use more than three non-minion creatures per character. For example, a party of four player characters usually shouldn't fight more than twelve non-minion creatures at a time. Going beyond this limit could increase the difficulty of an encounter.

For instance, if you're building a hard encounter for four 5th-level characters, you have a CR budget of 10 with a CR cap of 8. You could build any of the following encounters with these guidelines:

- A **bugbear predator** (CR 3), a **lizardfolk terrorsaur** (CR 4), and an **owlbear** (CR 3)
- **Dohma Raskovar** (CR 5), ten **orc blitzer**s (CR 1/2 minions), and two **orc rampart**s (CR 2)
- Four **gnoll abyssal archer**s (CR 1/2), a **gnoll bonesplitter** (CR 4), four **gnoll marauder**s (CR 1/2), and ten **gnoll wildling**s (CR 1 minions)
- A **gibbering mouther** (CR 2) and a **time raider nemesis** (CR 8)
- Five **ogre**s (CR 2)

> ##### Start Slow
>
>The creatures in this book have more flexibility and depth than those presented in the core rules. Many of their attacks do more than simply damage enemies. Their unique traits, bonus actions, and reactions make them more interesting—but also more complicated than other creatures. That little bit of complexity can add up if you use a lot of different stat blocks in an encounter.
>
>Until you're used to running complex encounters, take it easy the first few times you use a stat block from this book—we recommend not using more than three unfamiliar stat blocks in an encounter. While it might be tempting to use every gnoll in one grand battle, give yourself time to figure out how these creatures work before using a bunch of stat blocks at once.
>

### Tweaking Difficulty

While these new encounter-building guidelines can help you target the difficulty of an encounter, it's impossible for any system to account for the countless details that vary widely from game to game. Keep an eye out for the following factors when building encounters, and tweak the difficulty as needed.

#### Party Composition

A well-rounded party with a cleric, a fighter, a rogue, and a wizard is going to handle combat differently than a group of four barbarians. The new encounter-building system works well for the former group, but a group of typical barbarians tears through combat with melee-focused enemies . . . and loses just as quickly against foes who force them to make a lot of Intelligence or Wisdom saving throws.

Keep the mix of character classes and other features in mind as you build encounters. Play to the characters' strengths when you want to ensure success. Exploit their weaknesses when you want to challenge them—but do so sparingly. First and foremost, the game should be fun.

You can increase the encounter's difficulty one step (for example, from standard to hard) if the encounter exploits most of the characters' weaknesses. Decrease it one step if it plays into most of their strengths.

#### Player Play Styles

The mechanics of fifth edition reward system mastery. Experienced and rules-invested players often build characters who are more powerful than average by synergizing ancestries, classes, feats, spells, and other elements of the game. Likewise, players who are less experienced or rules invested may build characters below average power. Depending on who plays in your group, you may need to tweak the numbers to challenge (or avoid slaughtering) the characters.

#### Magic Items

The core rules make some brief suggestions about distributing magic items, but there are no hard-and-fast rules about how many or what kind of magic items to give to characters. Some GMs shower characters with countless baubles and *vorpal sword*s while others hand out one *potion of healing* once every five levels. Most games are somewhere in between. Keep in mind that a group with many powerful magic items is going to have a much easier time at any level. And especially at higher levels, a group with few magic items will have a tougher time battling powerful creatures—doubly so when a party without magic weapons has to overcome a creature's damage immunities and resistances!

If a character has more magic items than the average suggested in the core rules, consider that character to be one level higher when determining the party's average character level.

#### Short Rests

The number of short rests the characters take during a day influences the difficulty of encounters, especially if the characters have important class features that recharge during a short rest (like the warlock's Pact Magic). A short rest after every battle makes things a lot easier, and no short rests at all makes the adventuring day much tougher the longer it goes on.

If the characters take more than two short rests during an adventuring day, add an extra 2 points to your daily encounter budget.

#### Environment

Combat encounters don't typically occur in big empty rooms. Hazards, terrain, traps, and even the shape of an environment can change the difficulty of an encounter. An encounter is easier if there's a choke point where the characters can easily fight a group of dangerous monsters one at a time, while a sphere of annihilation rolling through a hallway can make an easy battle turn deadly.

Similarly, you may need to increase the encounter's difficulty by one step if it includes an environment that deals damage to the characters but not their enemies, or if it inflicts the blinded, charmed, dazed,  frightened, petrified, poisoned, paralyzed, restrained, stunned, or unconscious conditions or similar effects on the characters but not their enemies.

## Converting Ancestries

This book contains multitudes of creatures—but really, does any GM ever have enough stat blocks? The **orc rampart** is a great soldier, but perhaps a kobold version of that creature would better suit your campaign. Or perhaps you need an angulotl who functions like the **lizardfolk terrorsaur**.

To expand your stat block options, you can use the rules in this section to convert non-minion stat blocks from any ancestry on this list to another:

- Angulotls
- Bugbears
- Devils
- Gnolls
- Goblins
- Hobgoblins
- Humans
- Kobolds
- Lizardfolk
- Orcs
- Time raiders

To convert a stat block to a new ancestry from this list, the creature should lose the defining features of their original ancestry (as listed in the following sections) and gain the defining features of their new ancestry. However, if the original creature's walking speed is 40 feet or more, keep their original walking speed.

### Angulotl Defining Features

An angulotl has the following defining features:

- **Size.** The angulotl's size is Small.
- **Type.** The angulotl's type is Humanoid.
- **Speed.** The angulotl has a walking speed of 20 feet, a climbing speed of 20 feet, and a swimming speed of 30 feet.
- **Damage Immunities.** The angulotl is immune to poison damage.
- **Darkvision.** The angulotl has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- **Languages.** The angulotl can speak, read, and write Angulotl.
- **Amphibious.** The angulotl can breathe air and water.
- **Toxiferous.** When a creature hits the angulotl with a melee attack while within 5 feet of them or touches the angulotl, that creature takes 2 (1d4) poison damage.
- **Hop.** The angulotl jumps a number of feet up to their walking speed as a bonus action.

### Bugbear Defining Features

A bugbear has the following defining features:

- **Size.** The bugbear's size is Medium.
- **Type.** The bugbear's type is Humanoid.
- **Speed.** The bugbear has a walking speed of 30 feet.
- **Darkvision.** The bugbear has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- **Languages.** The bugbear can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

# Chapter 1: Creatures

From swarms of spiders to ancient wyrms, the creatures who appear most often in your games are in this chapter. All the creatures are listed in alphabetical order. Refer to the introduction if you want to see the creatures listed by challenge rating. Most of the creature entries feature more than one stat block, providing different roles like action-oriented creatures, companions, minions, and retainers.

## Angulotls

*This river water taste funny to you, Sir Rogar?*— Maxidroga, Deceased Squire of Sir RogarFound in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Angualotl.html](ang-gwa-LAH-tulls)) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces only accessible by water. They are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to an angulotl clutch without realizing it. Though angulotls prefer to avoid combat, when they're threatened or pressed, they turn deadly.

***Deadly Toxins.*** Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression—they don't need to be! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat; they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.

***Indicator Species.*** Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn't take much to upset it. While toxins don't kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path—even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most . . . and sometimes gives them strange abilities.

***Moisture Dependent.*** Angulotls breathe through their skin, but they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in very dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from a source of freshwater . . . unless it's raining.

### Clawfish

Known as q'ukutxal ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Qukutxal.html](koo-OOK-oot-shaal)) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small beasts can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by choking or electrocuting foes.

**Angulotl Blade**

*They like humans! Adults tend to freak them out a little. I don't think they realize tall humans are the same species as tiny humans!*— Pinna, Hedge Witch, Gravesford**Angulotl Needler**

**Angulotl Seer**

**Angulotl Slink**

> ##### Angulotl Tactics
>
>Angulotls prefer to battle their foes in partially aquatic environments that include lots of vegetation or other places to hide. This allows the angulotls to leap from the water, attack, and then retreat into the murk or bushes. Marshes, swamps, and jungle rivers make ideal showdown locations.
>
>An **angulotl slink** can give combat an interesting twist if they grab a magic item away from a character with their Tongue Nab attack then retreat, changing a deadly showdown into a dynamic chase. Just give the characters a fighting chance to get back any stolen goods!
>

**Angulotl Tadpole**

**Clawfish**

> ##### Angulotl Magic Items
>
>Angulotl value magic items that enhance their low Strength, such as *gauntlets of ogre power* and *potions of giant strength*. Some angulotl seers take great pleasure in brewing *potions of growth* and quaffing them whenever they need to intimidate a threat.
>

**Angulotl Yegg**

**Clawfish Companion**

> ##### Mystic Connection: Clawfish
>
>If you're playing a beastheart and have a **clawfish companion**, you gain the following benefit at 9th level when you gain the beastheart's Mystic Connection feature:
>
>***Riverkith.*** You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can breathe lightning in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your exploit save DC, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
>

## Animals

Animals play a prominent role in every fantasy story and can be found in every environment. This section introduces new fantastical beasts and offers fresh takes on popular predators and companions.

### Optional Features

The timescape holds many more animals than one book could possibly contain. To aid in customizing the animals in this section—or even creating new ones—some creatures are accompanied by tables of optional features you can add to their stat blocks. These features are often based on realworld creatures the stat block can represent, and the table gives examples of those creature varieties.

***Challenge Rating Adjustments.*** If an optional feature increases a creature's challenge rating, this is indicated in parentheses at the end of that feature. If a creature's original CR was less than 1 and you select a feature that adds 1 to their CR, their CR increases to 1 regardless of whether their original CR was 0, 1/8, 1/4, or 1/2.

Since optional features increase a creature's power, they shouldn't be added to a companion creature without the GM's permission. This applies even to features that don't impact their official challenge rating.

***Repurposing Stat Blocks.*** You can use these tables to inspire the creation of various animals in your fantasy world—perhaps a certain island is home to bears who have webbed feet and can breathe underwater while hunting aquatic prey, or maybe a powerful devil is accompanied by an infernal lion who exhales gouts of flame.

You can also reflavor stat blocks and optional features to represent other real-world creatures. For example, an albatross isn't technically a bird of prey, but you can make an excellent albatross stat block by using a **bird of prey** with the Ocean Hunter and Glide features from the Optional Bird of Prey Features table. Similarly, the **little wildcat** stat block can be handily used for a jackal, fox (give a fennec fox the same features as a sand cat), or dhole (add the Deadly Bite and Pack Tactics features).

### Bears

Known for their immense strength, formidable stature, and status as apex predators in forests, mountains, and ice sheets, bears are revered (and feared) as embodiments of nature's might.

***Ursine Variation.*** In our own world, bears vary in size and diet. The brown bear (a category that includes the grizzly bear and Kodiak bear) and polar bear are the largest land predators in the world—though despite their bulk, they can sprint toward their prey at terrifying speeds. On the other hand, the giant panda and much smaller sun bear are herbivores, while the odd sloth bear uses their long, curved claws to dig up ants and termites.

### Birds of Prey

Also known as raptors, birds of prey are the consummate avian predators. They hunt from the skies and dive toward their quarry at extraordinary speeds, either killing on impact or raking the unlucky target with their powerful beaks and talons.

***Avian Variation.*** Birds of prey include eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, vultures, and more. From snowy owls in the frozen tundra to desert condors, raptors rule the skies.

### Camels

As consummate desert travelers, camels are known for their characteristic hump (or humps). These masses of fatty tissue help regulate a camel's body temperature, and when food is scarce, the humps can be metabolized for nutrition. Camels also have large eyebrows and eyelashes that shield their eyes from the harsh desert glare, and their powerful jaws masticate thorny desert plants, wood, and the occasional unwise attacker.

### Deathhawk

This carrion bird is known in various cultures as the deathhawk, flesh-eater, scourger, or great devourer. They feast on rotting flesh—the more decayed, the better. With a wingspan of nearly 8 feet, bone-white feathers, and a piercing, blood-chilling shriek, even one deathhawk is a sight most mortals hope never to encounter.

***Harbingers of Death.*** Fittingly, a group of deathhawks is known as a foreboding. They have an uncanny sense of imminent bloodshed, and forebodings often circle above a besieged settlement or future battlefield for days, awaiting the coming feast. After the carnage, they linger for weeks at a time, slowly devouring the dead as they wait for the fresh bodies to become maggot-riddled corpses.

***Meal Prep.*** Though deathhawks prefer decomposing flesh, they hunt live prey if no corpses are available—or if they are preparing for their young to hatch. While one deathhawk guards the nest, their mate hunts, accumulating a grisly collection of flesh that has plenty of time to rot before the scaly gray chicks are born.

***Undead Hunters.*** Deathhawks can prove useful to mortals—particularly those who hunt undead—for these birds are not only terrifyingly intelligent, but eager to eat the flesh of the living dead. Organizations devoted to resisting the scourge of unnatural forces raise deathhawks from chicks and train them to hunt.

### Lightning Eel

Lightning eels have mottled dark-gray skin threaded with trails of silvery blue. They continue growing throughout their lifetime, simply adding vertebrae to their long, sinuous bodies. A lightning eel might grow to 2 feet long in the first year of their life, but ancient lightning eels have been rumored to live for half a century and grow up to 30 feet long—a small sea serpent!

Lightning eels live in groups of ten to twenty individuals of various sizes, known as a flash. They can hunt alone or as a group to take down entire shoals of fish—or larger, more dangerous prey. The flash migrates between bodies of fresh and salt water, following the patterns of storms and hurricanes. The sight of a flash circling just beneath the surface is a sure sign of an impending storm.

### Snowfox

These winged white foxes live in frigid polar regions and high snow-covered plateaus. During the winter, a snowfox's beautiful coat and plumage are primarily white with a scattering of dark-gray speckles. In warmer months, their coat takes on more brown, gray, and black, helping them blend in with the shifting terrain. Snowfoxes tend to live in mated pairs (for life or for a season) and raise a litter of two to four kits at a time.

### Swarms

A droning, chirping, or clicking swarm of insectoids is a surprisingly daunting sight. Though they be but tiny, they are numerous and united in pursuit of their collective goal.

> ##### Content Warning: Insects and Spiders
>
>If you or any of your players are viscerally bothered by many-legged bugs, stinging insects, or spiders, you may want to avoid using the swarms in this section—or instead describe them as some other Tiny creature with substantially fewer legs.
>

### Wildcats

Felines of all shapes and sizes roam the wilds—and the occasional urban alleyway. Cats are usually solitary hunters who stalk their prey before bringing them down in one leap. Padded feet, sensitive whiskers, and long tails help them move nimbly and silently.

***Feline Variation.*** Many different cats live in woodlands, jungles, savannahs, and mountains. Big cats, like lions, cougars, and jaguars, use their strength to quell larger prey. Smaller felines, like ocelots, servals, margays, and even housecats, rely on their agility and reflexes to ambush their quarry.

*I know it's a cliché, but they really are more afraid of you than you are of them. And it's their forest, remember!*— Pinna, Hedge Witch, Gravesford**Bear**

**Little Bear**

> ##### Animal Handling in the Wild
>
>While Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks are typically limited to influencing trained or domesticated animals, you can lift this restriction to allow your characters to attempt to influence wild animals, such as a hungry panther who sees the party as dinner. Allowing the Animal Handling skill to influence wild beasts increases the versatility of a skill with a very limited number of uses in a typical game. It may be that you allow any character to attempt to use the skill to influence wild animals or that you restrict this special use to specific characters connected to nature, like druids and rangers.
>
>If you do allow Animal Handling to be used to influence wild animals, remember that skills aren't magic. The same way a single successful Charisma (Persuasion) check isn't likely to turn a hostile bandit who wants to kill you into an ally ready to fight by your side, a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can't turn a wolf the barbarian just punched in the face into a loyal pet. But it might convince the wolf to scurry off in search of easier prey.

##### Optional Bear Features
| Feature                                       |                                Variety of Bear                               |   |

> ##### Wild Shape and Optional Features
>
>At the GM's discretion, the beasts presented in the "Animals" entry can be Wild Shape options for druids. A druid player should also get their GM's approval before adding any of the optional features to a creature's stat block. For instance, a GM might be fine with a druid turning into a **bird of prey** using the base stat block presented in this entry but not allow the Decapitating Strike trait to be added to it.
>

**Bird of Prey**

**Dire Bird of Prey**

##### Optional Bird of Prey Features

**Ancient Lightning Eel**

**Snowfox**

>
>**Familiar.** The snowfox can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with their willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the snowfox senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, the snowfox can use the companion's proficiency bonus for ability checks, and the snowfox gains temporary hit points equal to the companion's proficiency bonus at the end of a long rest. Either creature can end the bond at any time.
>

**Swarm of Insects**

> ##### Researched Options
>
>Many of the optional features provided for the different animal stat blocks are based on the incredible abilities of critters from the real world. Sometimes the best ideas for fantasy come from the truly wild nature of reality. Do an internet search for an aye-aye and you'll see.
>
>If you need inspiration for new creature traits and actions, research the surprising things that animals can do. You might be as shocked as we were when we learned that some bears can run more than 30 miles per hour and many wildcats can survive falls as high as four stories without injury.
>

##### Optional Insect Swarm Features

**Swarm of Spiders**

**Wildcat**

> ##### Surprise Swarm!
>
>Because a swarm of insects or spiders can fit into any reasonably sized vessel, you can surprise players by having bugs burst forth from a chest, pack, or other container. A trap could dispense a swarm in a manner similar to how it might shoot a jet of flame or unleash poison gas. A swarm surprise is such good fun for many groups that we made it part of a stat block: a **swarm of spiders** emerges from the corpse of a newly deceased **war spider** (see the "*Goblins*" entry).
>
>Before you unleash such a horrifying surprise on unsuspecting players, make sure it is the kind of thing that will thrill them in a good way. Ask your players about their comfort level with swarms, insects, and spiders and adjust your story and descriptions to the taste of your players.
>

## Basilisks

*They're great guard dogs. You just gotta raise 'em from eggs. No, no. Don't look her in the eye. She turned the tax collector to stone the other day when he tried to pet her. She's just a big softie, really.*

With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat—even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into immobilized stone statues. Horrifyingly, the basilisk's petrified prey remain aware of their fate and surroundings, trapping them in an unending nightmare.

***Many Environments.*** One of the most adaptable predators, basilisks can be found in nearly any environment, but they prefer damp caves. Over time, their tough scales take on the color of their surroundings, allowing the bulky creatures to blend in better.

***Raising Young.*** Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise several younglings. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. On the other hand, basilisk younglings can only eat petrified victims, and families of basilisk have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.

***Dangerous Servitors.*** . Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to raise and train as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone as the basilisk escapes and runs amok.

Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas, largely due to their own limited options for companionship, commonly keep basilisks as pets. Both parties benefit from this symbiotic relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.

***Alchemical Properties.*** Alchemists have discovered that after a basilisk eats petrified flesh, the basilisk's gullet produces an oil that can be used to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.

> ##### Petrification Is Death
>
>A permanent petrified condition can take a low-level character out of the game like death. Some players might not like that a creature with a challenge rating of 3 can knock them out of the story. That's why the basilisk has the Alchemical Ingredients trait. Remove this trait for a more dangerous basilisk.
>

> ##### Reversing Petrification
>
>Petrification usually can't be reversed without the *greater restoration* spell or similarly powerful magic. However, the basilisk companion's Lesser Petrifying Gaze is weaker than that of most basilisks, allowing it to be countered with a *cure ailment* power or *lesser restoration* spell.

## Bugbears

The oldest and largest of the goblinoids, bugbears combine remarkable silence with unusual strength. Most adventurers don't sense an approaching bugbear until a heavy weapon connects with the adventurer's skull. These fur-covered goblinoids thrive in almost any environment, inhabiting frigid tundra and sun-soaked plain alike—but good luck finding a bugbear tribe that doesn't want to be found.

***Survival Lessons.*** Bugbears can trace their lineage back to the earliest days of civilization, when surviving in a harsh world teeming with monsters was no easy task. The bugbears of that ancient era passed down hardlearned lessons to their descendants. Every generation evolved and innovated these traditions, forging a people of fierce warriors, silent hunters, and powerful mages. Though many bugbears live peaceable lives or fight in defense of innocents, those who turn to evil wield these lessons to form armies of marauders and assassins.

***Inspiring Goblinoids.*** So great is a bugbear's might and grace that they inspire others to fight on against overwhelming odds. Bugbears often recruit other goblinoids before a battle, but their inspiration doesn't end with other goblinoids. Clever commanders who lead humanoids know the benefit of keeping a bugbear in their ranks beyond their mere skill as a warrior.

***Prepared for Battle.*** Bugbear training emphasizes that preparation is key to winning a battle. They prefer to pick their battlefields, preparing an ambush area with traps, reinforcements, and escape routes. At home, they leave no gaps in their defenses, often maintaining secret paths or havens where they can regroup, resupply, and continue the fight if caught unaware by invaders.

> ##### Bugbear Encounters
>
>While bugbears work well together, each has unique traits and actions that bolster their allies. Using multiple types of bugbears at once can increase the GM's mental load and make it easy to forget things in combat. Before running a combat with three different bugbears, you may wish to get a feel for how they affect battle by trying one bugbear with other allies, like goblins or hobgoblins.
>

**Bugbear Predator**

**Bugbear Regular**

> ##### Bugbear Tactics
>
>Most bugbears prefer to start a fight with an ambush. They pick a spot where they know their foe will pass through, set the area with traps, then hide with their allies and wait. When it's time to strike, a bugbear positions themself and moves as necessary so that as many allies as possible benefit from their Bugbear's Inspiration trait.
>
>When commanding others, bugbears coordinate their allies to focus fire on healers first so that the rest of their foes go down more quickly. If losing a battle, bugbears retreat to a secondary location, where they can hide and spring out to gain the upper hand against any pursuers. These secondary locations are stocked with potions and ammunition and guarded by traps.
>

**Bugbear Roughneck**

**Bugbear Warden**

> ##### Bugbear Magic Items
>
>Bugbears benefit from magic items that enhance their stealth capabilities, such as the *cloak of elvenkind* or *potion of invisibility*. Since bugbears position themselves in battle to be close to their allies, magic items that provide benefits to nearby companions, such as the *rod of alertness* or a *spell scroll* of *mass healing word*, make excellent choices.
>
>Bugbears are generous with their magic items. Before a battle, a bugbear may lend or even gift one of their items to an ally who can make better use of it. During a fight, a bugbear might toss a potion or magic weapon to a cornered ally. A bugbear whose defeat is imminent could quickly cast off a magic shield or scroll so a friend can grab the item before their enemies.
>

*Number one rule against these guys? Kill the bugbear first. You have no idea how much worse they make fighting goblins. Bugbears are what we call a force multiplier—and it is not a small multiple.*— The Sun, Senior Pyrokinetic, The Society
## Chimeras

Massive flexing claws. Lashing draconic tail. Nimble leathery wings. And not one, but three menacing heads: a snarling lion, a helix-horned ram, and a dragon with fire sparking in its throat. Many see the chimera as an aggressor, but few know its origins as a divine guardian.

***The First Chimera.*** The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian—one with the intelligence of a dragon, the bravery of a lion, and the tenacity of a ram. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector of not just her person, but of her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the monstrosity. As a conquering force swept into the land, their first defilement of peace was slaughtering the chimera.

The queen's resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras overtook the opposing army and dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.

***Fiercely Faithful.*** When a chimera acts as a guardian, almost nothing can shake that loyalty. They are viciously territorial over objects, creatures, and founts of magic they defend. Even when the charges they defend turn wicked, chimeras remain faithful, willing to lay down their lives.

***Corrupted Loyalty.*** Mortals who earn a chimera's trust can tempt and train the monstrosity to bring out the worst of their three parts: a dragon's greed, a lion's pride, and a goat's stubbornness. Such chimeras happily serve evil mortals.

***Tactical Warriors.*** Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The sound of the three heads crying together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.

***One Being, Three Heads.*** Unlike many other multiheaded creatures, a chimera has a single mind. Their heads work together, never snapping at one another over food, favors, or personality conflicts. The heads often express the chimera's emotions in unison, braying together in times of battle or purring all at once to show affection.

> ##### Protector Variant
>
>If you want to use the chimera as a bodyguard for another creature, you can add this trait to their stat block:
>
>***Protector.*** The **chimera** is divinely bound to another creature, who is their charge. When the chimera and their charge are on the same plane, the charge can telepathically communicate with the chimera, and the chimera knows the distance and direction to the charge. If the chimera is within 60 feet of the charge, half of any damage the charge takes (rounded up) is transferred to the chimera.

## Demons

Demons spawn in the Abyssal Wasteland, where evil and chaos meet. These creatures of incarnate evil need violence and suffering the way most other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture or tear apart lesser demons for fun.

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, with a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features—one might have an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another could have a human arm growing from their forehead.

***Mortal Alliances.*** Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Though these alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.

### Demons and Souls

Demons feast not on food or water, but on souls. These fuel their bloodthirsty powers, and while starved for souls, a demon can scarcely think.

#### Soul Count

A demon's stat block states the number of souls a given demon has already consumed at the beginning of combat. This number is presented right under their hit points in a similar fashion: both as a die expression and as an average number.

#### Soul Devourer

Demons can gain more souls by slaying other creatures, as described in their Soul Devourer trait. Unlike hit points, there is no maximum limit to a demon's soul count.

#### Soul-Fueld Power

Most demons have one or more features that require souls to use.

***Passive Traits.*** Passive traits automatically take effect after a demon's soul count crosses the threshold described in that trait. The trait remains active until the demon's soul count drops below the threshold, and the trait reactivates when the demon's soul count equals or exceeds it.

***Active Features.*** During an encounter, a demon can burn souls to use or enhance certain abilities. When they do, their soul count decreases by the number indicated. This cost is sometimes noted in parentheses at the beginning of an ability, such as "(Costs 1 Soul)." Other times, the text of the ability itself describes it, such as saying "the demon can burn 1 soul" for an additional effect.

#### Lethe

When a demon's soul count drops to 0, they fall into a state known as lethe—a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume. See a demon's Lethe trait for more information.

#### Soulsight

Demons have a special sense called soulsight, allowing them to perceive each creature, other than Constructs and Undead, within a certain radius. Soulsight doesn't rely on sight but counts as "seeing" for features that require sight. Neither physical objects (including total cover) nor supernatural effects can impede soulsight unless otherwise stated. A demon's stat block lists the radius of their soulsight under "Senses."

> ##### Adjusting Lethality
>
>Soul devouring makes demons deadly opponents. To give characters a better chance of living through their encounter with a demon, you can reduce the DC of the saving throw—or you can remove the saving throw entirely, and only allow a demon to devour a soul when a creature dies within 60 feet of them through other means. On the other hand, you might like to scale up the deadliness with more powerful demons! If so, instead of always using a DC 11 saving throw, you can set the DC equal to 8 + the demon's proficiency bonus.
>

### Demonic Hierarchy

Mortal scholars classify demons in nine categories—the higher a demon's category, the more powerful the fiend. Though demons don't use these classifications themselves, scholars are correct that demons have a hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they may evolve into a more powerful demon. Though Category 1 demons typically become Category 2 demons after consuming just one soul, there's no known pattern to how more powerful demons evolve. For example, some Category 2 demons evolve to Category 3 after consuming just one soul, while others must devour thousands before earning a promotion. This evolution can be instant, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether these evolutions are aided by consuming souls that are especially corrupt or heroic.

The following sections describe the most common types of Category 1–5 demons, though there are many other types of demons within these categories.

#### Pitling

The most common Category 1 demon, pitlings resemble rodents or insects—but with gleaming green eyes, terrible body odor, and viscous, toxic phlegm. If a pitling moves to a new region with different wildlife, they slowly change form over time to better match the appearance of a local pest.

#### Ruinant

Beings with glowing eyes and tendriled maws, ruinants breathe with a sickening wheeze and have bodies covered in inflamed scars. These Category 2 demons aim to kill healers first, knowing that such tactics make the rest of their prey fall faster. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the ruinant's own body.

#### Tormenauk

The tormenauk resembles a hulking ape with a dozen or more extra mouths randomly distributed around their body. Though their brute force is formidable enough, this Category 3 demon also inflicts raw psychic pain by screaming from their mouths in different voices—often using the agonized voices of souls the tormenauk has devoured.

#### Wobalas

The wobalas prefers to kill from afar while protected by allies. These Category 4 demons press lesser demons and mortals into service, first using them as meat shields, then devouring them when the wobalas needs a soul.

Wobalases have wildly different physical forms, but each wields a flesh bow attached to one of their limbs. This bow fires magical arrows that imbue their enemies with despair.

#### Chimeron

When a demon evolves to Category 5, their four previous forms sometimes meld into a chimeron, a horrid conglomeration of maws and mismatched body parts. The chimeron feels the hunger of all their mouths at the same time, and no number of souls can sate them.

#### Category 6 and Beyond

After devouring thousands of souls, a demon who reaches Category 6 develops a unique form and individual identity—the latter of which persists through future evolutions. These ancient demons thrive in the brutal chaos of the Abyss, each commanding a squad of bloodthirsty fiends.

Category 9 demons—the demon lords—are the most powerful. Their names are whispered carefully, their power rivals the gods', and their schemes ruin worlds.

### Aurumvas of Meaningless Greed

Covetous is too soft a word to describe the avarice of Aurumvas ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Aurumvas.html](or-UM-vahs)). This towering Category 6 demon wears a stack of crowns atop his reptilian head. His gaudy robe of gold and jewels hangs open, exposing his bare chest.

Aurumvas hungers for riches just as much as souls. His private vaults in the Abyssal Wastes hold treasures his band of demons has slaughtered hundreds of creatures to acquire. All he does is gaze on them and want for more.

Understanding that one needs to spend wealth to make it, Aurumvas is willing to part with smaller treasures to hire lesser fiends and wicked mortals. Someday his hoards and hordes may cover the timescape while he rules from atop a pile of platinum.

**Chimeron**

**Pitling**

**Ruinant**

**Tormenauk**

**Wobalas**

**Aurumvas**

> ##### Teleporting Aurumvas
>
>Aurumvas's Greed Is Good bonus action allows him to teleport all over the battlefield. By the time the characters are ready to face him in a mortal showdown, each likely has at least a few expensive magic items or pieces of equipment worth at least 100 gp. That allows Aurumvas to teleport to the most vulnerable and unprotected foe each round and unleash his Greedy Hands attacks upon them.
>

## Devils

In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly against each other for power and control—a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Compared to other fiends, devils appear remarkably humanoid, but infernal attributes such as horns, hooves, tails, and wings still set them apart.

***Precarious Pyramids.*** The Seven Cities are built on a strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Draconian chains of command place each devil in service to a higher authority—typically a more powerful devil. While devils are lawful, they're always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.

***Silver Tongues.*** These winsome fiends can acquire great influence through corrupting mortal souls—who then become subordinate devils when they die. Devils are virtuosos with words, skilled at tempting and coercing people into performing atrocities. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals—greed, revenge, vanity—or just simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil's supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it's too late.

***True Names.*** All devils have two names: one they're commonly known by, and another secret true name. Every devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning the fiend or to strip them of their power.

***Hell's Defectors.***  Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some others do desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell's bureaucracy—for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it leaves open a passage to the Mundane World that an enterprising devil can cross through.

Some of these defectors cling to old habits, acquiring power in mortal spheres of business, law, or politics. Others, inspired by mortals, join adventuring parties or set out to explore the world. These devils and their descendants are often colloquially known as tieflings.

### Infernal Chancellor Lazivos

To reach the rank of chancellor, Lazivos ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Lazivos.html](LAH-zih-vohs)) has executed dozens of intricate schemes, uttered hundreds of deceptions into opportune ears, and positioned count less rivals into unfortunate—yet completely compromising—circumstances.

And still, he remains unsatisfied.

Lazivos now pursues election to the Court of Seven Cities. In the meantime, he gladly commands and exploits his assembly of devils to curry favor and acquire loftier connections. His agents manipulate mortals and collect powerful relics on his behalf, ever expanding his reach and strengthening his grip.

A consummate narcissist, Lazivos dislikes dirtying his own hands unless absolutely necessary. Even when forced into a fight, the infernal chancellor coerces his enemies into aiding him, weakening them even further.

### Summoning Devils

Ritually summoning a devil is not to be taken lightly. These rituals are costly and dangerous, and those determined to see it through are typically desperate, driven, or simply foolish. This section explains the rules for summoning devils, the costs involved, and the consequences of such a ritual.

#### The Ritual

To perform a ritual to summon a devil, a creature must meet the following requirements.

***Material Components.*** The ritual requires the following material components, which are consumed regardless of whether the ritual succeeds (see "Summon Check"):

- 500 gp worth of brimstone
- 500 gp worth of obsidian
- 250 gp worth of magical incense, chalk, and candles
- 125 gp worth of Celestial blood, blessed by a priest (if such blood is unavailable, the priest can bless 250 gp worth of Humanoid blood in its place)

***Personal Sacrifice.*** A creature who attempts to summon a devil must sacrifice their vitality as follows, regardless of whether the ritual succeeds (see "Summon Check"):

- The summoner rolls a number of d10s equal to their level or challenge rating (minimum of 1) and loses hit points equal to the result.
- The summoner also expends half their maximum Hit Dice with no effect. (If the summoner has less than half their maximum Hit Dice available, they can't perform this ritual until they regain enough Hit Dice.) Hit Dice expended in this way can't be regained until the *greater restoration* spell is cast on the summoner twice within the same hour, or by means of a *wish* spell.

> ##### Finding Components and True Names
>
>Most of the material components required for summoning devils can be purchased at churches or magic shops. The characters might also come across these components in a cult hideout, an abandoned wizard's tower, or the lair of any creature who has cause to consort with fiends.
>
>Characters might discover a devil's true name in a dusty tome after months of research, or they could hear it from the lips of a lesser devil with a score to settle. If you're using the domain rules in *Kingdoms & Warfare*, the characters can discover a devil's true name with a successful Lore test (DC equals 10 + the devil's challenge rating).
>

***Ritual Length.*** When summoning a devil, a creature can perform either an instantaneous or hour-long ritual.

A desperate creature can use their action to perform an instantaneous ritual, which has a greater chance of failure. However, the exacting steps performed in an hour-long ritual reduce the summon check DC by 3.

***True Name.*** A creature who knows a devil's true name can speak it aloud when performing the ritual. Invoking a devil's true name reduces the summon check DC by 5, and if the ritual succeeds, it summons the specific devil whose name was spoken.

***Summon Check.*** To finish the ritual, a creature must make a summon check. This is a DC 18 Charisma check, though the DC decreases if the summoner performs an hour-long ritual or uses a devil's true name. "Ritual Consequences" details the results of a successful or failed summon check.

Another creature can assist the summoner with the ritual by taking the Help action. They are branded with the same infernal rune as the summoner, as described in "Ritual Consequences."

#### Ritual Consequences

Succeed or fail, summoning a devil has weighty consequences.

***Branded.*** Succeed or fail, a creature who attempts or assists in a summoning ritual is branded by an infernal rune on a prominent part of their body, such as their head, chest, or back. This rune marks them as someone who has tried to summon a devil. Communities and individuals who recognize the meaning of the rune may treat the summoner with fear, suspicion, or contempt.

***Success.*** If a creature succeeds on the summon check, roll on or choose from the Summoned Devil table to determine what type of devil is summoned (unless the summoner spoke a devil's true name during the ritual, thereby summoning that specific devil). At the GM's discretion, other devil types can be summoned instead.

A successful ritual binds the devil to a contract with the summoner. The devil must help the summoner with a specific task, such as finishing the current battle or aiding in a single quest objective. At the GM's discretion, a devil may be willing to extend the contract, but this has additional consequences for the summoner's soul and requires further payment, often in the form of favors.

##### Summoned Devil
|  d20  | Devil                       |   |
|:-----:|-----------------------------|---|
|  1-9  | Devil legate                |
| 10-14 | Devil jurist                |
| 15-17 | Devil magistrate            |
| 18-19 | Devil adjudicator           |
|   20  | Infernal Chancellor Lazivos |

***Failure.*** If a creature fails the summon check by 4 or fewer, no devil is summoned.

If a creature fails the summon check by 5 or more, a devil is summoned as in the "Success" section, but the fiend isn't contractually bound to the summoner and can act as they please. At the GM's discretion, the devil could still offer a contract—one that asks much of the summoner.

If a creature fails the summon check by 10 or more, they suffer the consequences of failing by 5 or more, and an additional planar entity—such as a such as a demon, an Elemental, or a Celestial—is also summoned. This additional entity is hostile toward the summoner.

*In the end we got Zalkith's devil-lieutenant to switch sides. We were lucky; Chance is a devilkin. She did all the talking. After the fight, the lieutenant wanted to broker some agreement, but we're not stupid. First rule of dealing with devils—don't sign anything.*— Dancer, Chronicler of the Chain of Acheron, Heroes 216–231
## Dragonets

The tiny cousins of majestic true dragons, dragonets are much less powerful—and prideful—than their larger kin. Though true dragons are essentially immortal, dragonets are omnivores who only live for about a century and need food to survive.

Each dragonet has a traditional Draconic name, but they also choose a nickname reserved for clutchmates, close friends, and their mate or mates (many dragonets mate for life with one or more partners). An adventurer who befriends a dragonet might even find the dragonet bestows a nickname on their new friend. The Dragonet Names table presents examples of dragonet names and nicknames.

Although dragonets rarely practice spellcraft themselves, they are attuned to arcane forces. These clever creatures have an innate understanding of spells and supernatural effects, as well as a keen sense for telling truth from fiction. Dragonets eschew deception and lies among friends, and they have little compunction about calling out untrue statements with varying levels of tact, though they understand well the need for lying to enemies.

***Family Bonds.*** True dragons recognize dragonets as kin, and most will protect a dragonet in danger—or at least try to avoid killing any dragonet caught up in their conflicts. Many dragons, dragonets, and humanoids alike believe that dragonets were created by dragons long ago, much as the dragon god created dragons themselves.

> ##### Variant: Dragonet Familiar
>
>Particularly adventurous dragonets are eager to accompany spellcasters as their companions or familiars. Dragonets tend to be curious, gregarious, and fiercely loyal to their chosen companions. Those who hope to befriend a dragonet should take note that their preferred foods are fresh fruit and fish (raw, seared, or smoked)—though dragonets introduced to humanoid delicacies also become particularly fond of spiced or sweetened nuts.
>
>***Familiar.*** The dragonet can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with their willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the dragonet senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, when the dragonet uses their Truesight action, their companion also has truesight while in physical contact with the dragonet. Either creature can end the bond at any time.

**Dragonet**

## Dragons

*We fear dragons above all else. Not only are they an expression of annihilation—our oldest and most basic dread—but they are a symbol of everything ancient, inscrutable, and unconquerable about our world.*

Cultures across the timescape covet, fear, and revere dragons in equal measure. To mortals, dragons are the penultimate monster, second only to titans, and a fearsome challenge for even the greatest mortals. To dragons themselves, they are survivors, remnants of a once-great age brought low by hubris now forgotten.

Those who remain are unbroken by the passage of the ages, biding their time as they plot to rise again—but a dragon's biggest obstacle is their own kin. These scaled sovereigns despise nothing more than bowing to another's will, especially another wyrm.

***Primal Majesty.*** Though many lesser creatures have been named "dragon" over the ages, there is no mistaking a true dragon's visage. These beings of legend inspire awe and terror in all who behold them—a reaction dragons proudly see as their due. They are majestic creatures, unrivaled in physical might and magical ability, and they know it.

Dragons are immune to the ravages of time, and those who have endured grow ever more powerful with age. The oldest among them become fountains of primal creation, their mere presence reshaping the world around them to their will.

***Ageless Grudge.***  With lives spanning millennia, dragons have a perspective mortals can scarcely comprehend, and they often hold grudges for slights committed against them or their kin long ago. But some resentments predate even a dragon's own existence. Enmities boil deep within their blood, burdening them with the anger of a thousand ancestors. This is the price of their immortality—an endless cycle of spite that keeps each dragon from trusting anyone except themself.

> ##### Campaign Bosses
>
>We made the choice to give you five serious ancient wyrms in this book instead of a greater number of unremarkable dragon stat blocks because every dragon battle should be memorable. Each dragon presented here can serve as the villain at the end of a campaign. Of course, some industrious GMs will find a way to tie all the dragons into their story. (Yes, that is a friendly challenge.)
>

### Durixaviinox

In a cold expanse at the edge of the world, Durixaviinox ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Durixaviinox.html](dur-ih-ZAH-vin-nox)) lairs beneath the ruins of the draconic city of Vexinoth. Though many now call him the Ruined Providence, this frost-breathing ruin dragon once ruled as a benevolent and all-powerful emperor who amassed enough reverence to rival the gods. But Durixaviinox was betrayed by his sister Yserthrax, who conspired with Qazyldrath to destroy the city. The conflict killed countless dragons on both sides and Durixaviinox was left for dead, his body buried beneath the rubble of a once-mighty civilization.

But the Providence refused to die, bringing himself back from the brink through force of will. As Durixaviinox slowly regained his physical might over a millennium of wound licking, he swore oaths of revenge against his sister and Qazyldrath. He plans to bring an eternal winter to the Mundane World, making it a place fit only for those with frigid hearts.

### Forzaantirilys

The blood dragon known as the Ashen Song is a creature of ash and cinder, her body wreathed in flames that burn with an unearthly heat. Forzaantirilys ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Forzaantilirys.html](for-zan-TILL-ih-riss)) lairs in the heart of the world's largest volcano, and if the rumors are true, she can see and hear through magma and lava flows everywhere.

Forzaantirilys is an inferno of anger, and this burning rage makes her immune to all fires, including the harsh light of the sun. She hates humanoids for their belief they are entitled to the Mundane World, and she abhors the gods who created them. The Ashen Song also despises the wyrm Xaantikorijek, who killed her mate, Frezzelvarax ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Frezzelvarax.html](frezz-el-VAR-ax)), nearly a thousand years ago. She wants nothing more than to see the world consumed and remade by her fire, though she knows wanton destruction would lead to her demise.

### Qazyldrath

Qazyldrath ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Qazyldrath.html](KAZZ-ill-drath)) is an ancient creature of nightmares, a manipulator of acid and shadows, a monster who has haunted mortal minds ever since the dragon's wings first engulfed the light of the sun. This gloom dragon's venerable age is surpassed only by the fear they command. Also known as the Sun Eater and the Silent Decay, Qazyldrath features heavily in the oral tradition of draconic ancestries; they're said to be one of the progenitors of lesser dragons and the one responsible for the viciousness of dragonkind.

Though Qazyldrath hasn't been seen in millennia, their influence is ever-present across the timescape. Many elven dialects still use variations of the dragon's name for the word "eclipse." Some people believe darkness amplifies Qazyldrath's power, and the Sun Eater will one day return to plunge the world into eternal shadow.

### Xaantikorijek

Deep beneath the barren wastes of the world rests one of its oldest creatures—so old, in fact, that he has forgotten his own name. This storm dragon has come to be known simply as the Voice of the Ages—or Xaantikorijek ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Xaantikorijek.html](zan-tihKOR-eh-jehk)) in Draconic.

Xaantikorijek is a master of thunder and lightning, and as part of the first brood to hatch on the Mundane World, he predates most of his surviving kin. Legend holds that the Voice of the Ages once knew a secret that could remake the Mundane World in whatever form they choose—but the aging wyrm remembers very little of his own past. Whether this was the cost of surviving the doom that befell the dragons of old, a self-imposed condition, or some other magical malady, is unknown even to Xaantikorijek.

Once every few centuries, however, Xaantikorijek remembers a detail about his lost history. It is said that when this happens, his voice resounds worldwide as he relays the fact to all dragonkin. The dragons eagerly hope he may someday remember how to reforge the world with dragons as rulers.

### Yserthrax

In the deepest and darkest parts of the timescape, there are beings that should not be, touched by corruption beyond worlds. One such creature is Yserthrax ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Yserthrax.html](EE-sur-thracks)), a draconic abomination whose wings are lined with hundreds of emerald eyes.

Yserthrax was born a venom dragon, revered for her mastery of spellcraft and occult lore. Now, she has been transformed by the machinations of elder evils, her body becoming distended and covered with strange growths.

The Many-Eyed earned her name not only for her eye-laden form. She is widely praised as one of the most cunning and devious among her kin, sought after for her arcane talents, spycraft, and intrigue. Little happens among dragonkind that Yserthrax doesn't see; she knows every great wyrm's desires and could manipulate them into carrying out the will of the elder evils that bind her.

> ##### Dragon Tactics
>
>Dragons seek lairs with lofty ceilings (or none at all) so they can use one of their greatest defenses: flight. A dramatic encounter with a dragon can quickly become a slog if the wyrm lands and never moves around the battlefield. Dragons are smart! They know to use their long reach and breath weapon to make life difficult for their enemies.
>
>Dragons choose extremely defensible places for their lairs, which are part home and part treasure vault. The wyrms rely on loyal guardians and an environment that is inhospitable to mortal treasure hunters and would-be heroes. For instance, Forzaantirilys makes her home in Mount Brazen, an enormous volcano that is hotter than the Seven Cities of Hell. Her treasure sits on an obsidian island floating in a lake of lava in the heart of the mountain. Just walking through the tunnels to reach Forzaantirilys's hoard would bake most people to death.
>

*Yserthrax and Morrax grappled. Her heart he sought to kill. Morrax fought. Morrax died. And Yserthrax lives still.*— Last stanza from the Tale of Morrax Qor, Steel Dwarf Hero, from the *Codex Valiar***Durixaviinox**

**Forzaantirilys**

*She'd destroy the world—herself included. They're all like that, the noble dragons. Draco Draconis. They're so old, pain is all they know.*— Lady Demelza, Courser**Qazyldrath**

**Xaantikorijek**

**Yserthrax**

## Elementals

*It is in changing that we find purpose.*— Atæshia, Queen of AshWhen the gods formed the Mundane World, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the universe's most basic elements—air, fire, earth, and water. Some elementals contain just one of these components, but the greatest embody multiple as creatures of ash, blood, ice, and similar reagents.

***Duality of Form.*** Elementals are mercurial creatures of transformation, creation, and destruction. Though the deities first created the Mundane World, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn't suit an elemental, they break it down with fire, wind, or another element, then build it anew.

Elementals themselves also change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are knights wrought of iron, lizards ablaze with fire, and angels of pure sunlight.

***Rebirth and Reformation.*** When an elemental dies in the Mundane World, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain strength. Should the spirit return to the Mundane World, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.

***Reactive Harmony.*** Each elemental can bolster themself or another elemental with the primordial power they embody. To maximize this power and to protect each other, elementals live and work in groups called *ishkrars*. This Primordial word translates literally to "family," but more accurately refers to a family that is not one's first.

***Driven Back by Mortals.*** When the divine host created humanoids, many of these mortals tore down what the elementals had built to make way for roads, buildings, mines, and war. When the elementals sought a peaceful resolution to this conflict, their diplomats were assassinated by evil mortals, igniting a war which the unprepared and disorganized elementals lost.

Surviving elementals retreated to remote locations, fortifying their positions beneath the waves, within volcanoes, and in other places uninhabitable for humanoids. Many elementals in the Mundane World hold the weakness of mortals in contempt; others don't fault humanoids, but instead blame the gods who created such selfish creatures.

> ##### Sapient Elementals
>
>This section presents sapient elementals that live and fight together as a band. Other elementals, called motes, exist in the timescape as well, but we didn't have the space for them in this book. Those elementals are less sapient than the ones presented here.
>

### Crux of Fire

The crux of fire, often called a blazecaster, takes the form of a fiery lizard. They often live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar—and if they don't like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near.

While many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.

### Crux of Frost

An entity of mirrored ice, the crux of frost is almost always covered by a frosted facade. They are commonly called frigid glintmasks due to their ability to imperfectly mimic creatures, inflicting supernatural terror on those they reflect. This fear makes the reflected creature more vulnerable to harm, their form and spirit withering to a brittle consistency under the crux's scrutiny.

### Essence of Mist

When an elemental's spirit enters the Mundane World, their form reflects an aspect of the world. When this reagent is the breath of a cold-blooded killer, the elemental becomes an essence of mist, also called a breath lurker.

The essence has the misty silhouette of a cloaked humanoid. A brutal weapon forms in their grasp as they strike, rendering their victims breathless.

### Essence of Storms

At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, or galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon.

Galeweavers act as scouts for their ishkrars, and they're usually the first to see trouble. Also insatiably curious, the essences often swoop down to talk when they see travelers.

### Essence of Tides

An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against regulars who sail or swim in their waters. With the tidedrifter's healthy sense of humor, it's not hard to win their friendship—but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friend or family faces threat.

> ##### Content Warning: Blood and Suffocation
>
>The **force of blood**, **blood seneschal**, and **essence of mist** manipulate the blood and breath of their enemies. If you or any of your players find descriptions of blood or suffocation upsetting, you may want to avoid using these elementals or reflavor their abilities.
>

### Force of Blood

Forces of blood, also called blood sovereigns, are warlords and diplomats who equally represent the birth of mortal life and the moment of its ending. They could be mistaken for a massive humanoid clad entirely in black-and-red toothed armor, but in truth, their "armor" is blackened, gnarled flesh punctuated with veins of boiling red.

Mortal monarchs would do well to take heed when a force of blood's scarlet lance approaches. These elementals keenly understand mortals and never treat with them for idle purpose.

### Force of Earth

A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of rough stone. They act as guardians and historians to their ishkrar, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.

### Force of Iron

A force of iron, also called an iron stalwart, appears as a four-armed centaur made of malleable metal with a head shaped like an empty knight's helm. Most are staunch, loyal, and uncompromising. Some forces of iron even achieve fame by facing down wickedness where they find it—but others become wickedness, using their strength to vanquish anything that even mildly displeases them.

### Oracle of Storms

An oracle of storms, or tempest augur, seeks the power and wisdom of the thundering clouds. While some oracles form family groups, many choose solitary lives atop lonely peaks, searching for answers in the billowing clouds. Their divinatory magics display the world's stories in the sky, etched in lightning and cloudy silhouettes.

Oracles often choose to take the shape of creatures they see as wise, such as storm giants made of thunderclouds.

### Principle of Growth

The principle of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Principles of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.

### Sparks

On their home planes, elemental sparks are living motes of floating air, earth, fire, and water. When one of these elemental minions travels to another world, they take the form of an animal native to that plane. In the Mundane World, air sparks appear as winged serpents, earth sparks appear as rhinoceroses, fire sparks appear as bears, and water sparks take on the appearance of octopuses.

### Sunlight Nexus

A being of pure radiance, a sunlight nexus is easily mistaken for a winged celestial made of stained glass. Closer inspection reveals they're formed of jagged multicolored motes of solid sunlight that move together in a dense nebula.

Sunlight nexuses often serve as emissaries for their ishkrar. Their angelic appearance and restorative abilities instantly earn the respect of many mortals, which the elementals use to their advantage in negotiations. Evil nexuses masquerade as celestials to trick religious humanoids into doing their bidding.

### Atæshia, Queen of Ash

Atæshia ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Ataeshia.html](ah-TAY-shee-ah)) was among the first elementals to inhabit the Mundane World, and the first to strike back against the mortals who attempted to tame the wild world. Her army clashed with humanoids for decades, but her enemies' numbers were too great and her allies too few. As the tides of war turned against the elementals, Atæshia knew it would be better for the elementals to live, rebuild their forces, and wait for another day to take back what was once theirs.

Atæshia considers all elementals within her ishkrar, and many would fight under her banner in turn. She hasn't forgotten their great war, and she views mortals and the gods who created them as the greatest threat to the timescape.

***Protected Realm.*** Atæshia spends most of her time atop Tempest, a great mountain with an upper half hidden in an enormous storm. Powerful elementals at the peak manifest lightning and hail the size of apples to hide the Ash Queen's realm. Any who brave the treacherous climb find that the center of the perpetual squall contains a sunny mountain paradise. Here, elementals shape the land with placid pools, burning lava geysers, icy sculptures, lush gardens, and anything else they wish to manifest. The only requirement to stay in Tempest is to believe in the Ash Queen's cause and follow her orders whenever you are called upon. Even those who aren't elementals are welcome to stay provided they observe Atæshia's rules.

***Yearly Journey.*** Once every year, Atæshia travels from Tempest to her reliquary, a tower built in the ruins of her failed war. Here, she takes time to remember and honor the departed, holding a weeks-long vigil surrounded by elemental guardians.

**Crux of Fire**

**Crux of Frost**

**Earth Spark**

> ##### Elemental Magic Items
>
>The elementals presented in this section favor magic items that let them summon Elemental companions, like the *censer of controlling air elementals* or *elemental gem*. These items conjure allies who can be immediately enhanced by the summoner, increasing the item's value and effect to the elementals who use them. Some elementals might also use items that create a damaging area of effect if their allies are immune to the damage's type. For instance, a force of iron who forms an ishkrar with several cruxes of fire and fire sparks can use a *necklace of fireballs* or the Shooting Stars effect of a *ring of shooting stars* without fear of harming their allies.
>

**Essence of Mist**

**Essence of Storms**

**Essence of Tides**

**Fire Spark**

> ##### Take Advantage of Immunities
>
>Elementals have damage and condition immunities that allow them to lair in environments most mortals would find deadly. For instance, a crux of frost, a force of earth, and a force of iron could lair together in an underground cavern filled with toxic mold since they're all immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.
>

*They're not evil. They're harbingers. You find them where the walls between worlds are very thin—and other things pass through the barriers with them.*— Lady Demelza, Courser**Force of Blood**

**Force of Earth**

*Quintessence's chronographic index of 1.86 qualifies it as a Lower World, only slightly higher energy than Manifold One. Because the two manifolds constructively interfere, the denizens of Quintessence often manifest on Manifold One, and many consider it their home. The presence of elementals may indicate an area of bilocation nearby.*— Remainer**Force of Iron**

**Oracle of Storms**

> ##### Elemental Convocations
>
>Each elemental has a bonus action called a convocation that makes them strongest when working with other creatures of the Elemental type. This includes some not found in this section of the book, like the **fossil cryptic** in the "Cave" environment of chapter 2. When you build an encounter with elementals, pay special attention to their bonus action options. That way, when initiative is rolled, you'll already know how each elemental can aid their allies.
>
>Many elementals can use only their convocation once or twice per day. It's best to use these options at the start of an encounter instead of waiting for later rounds of combat, since an elemental could perish before they get the chance to do their cool thing.
>
>You can create unique elementals by swapping one convocation for another. For instance, you could create an essence of storms who is infused with air and earth properties by trading the creature's Convocation of Air for the force of earth's Convocation of Earth. You could even rename the creature the essence of sandstorms.
>
>When you swap the convocations of two elementals, pay close attention to each creature's challenge rating. You'll likely want to adjust the numbers for damage, saving throw DCs, and other effects to better match the stat block you're using. Look at that creature's original convocation to get some target numbers.
>

**Water Spark**

**Atæshia**

**Blood Seneschal**

**Lava Bastion**

> ##### Elemental Retainers and Companions
>
>This book presents two elemental retainers who are fully sapient (like most other elementals in this section). The earth elemental companion is a more traditional elemental who might be summoned by a spellcaster to serve as a guardian; they therefore work better as a companion.
>

**Earth Elemental Companion**

## Giants

Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains.

Though giants sometimes live near humanoid settlements, the latter often pass their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few "smallfolk" structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.

***Adaptable and Elemental.*** Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn't simply live on a mountain—they're part of the mountain, and it's part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, "Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?"

***Distant Cousins.*** Humanoid scholars usually assume all giants are related, though giants don't view their kin as brethren by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants tend to detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they're willing to be in the vanguard. Though giants rarely go to war with one another, their battles can change the very geography of a continent, causing earthquakes, storms, and volcanic eruptions.

### Fire Giants

Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma alike, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake. Though their reputation is one of violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding.

***Martial Artists.*** Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat up to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing straps to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into the perfect weapons of war.

### Zenith Aastrika

Once a lieutenant of the Sunlight Legion, Aastrika fought and clawed through the ranks, proving herself in battle after battle. However, she suspected many above her felt threatened by her meteoric rise, and her suspicions were confirmed when her unit was dispatched deep into the desert. There, Aastrika discovered signs of blue dragon territory and realized her superiors had ordered her into a trap.

On sharing her discovery with her unit, they decided together to desert the legion. Rather than face the dragon, Aastrika and her troops pursued spiritual enlightenment. They roamed the highest sunlit mountain peaks and deepest volcanic caverns in search of understanding. In one of these magma tunnels, Aastrika crawled deep into a volcanic crater and remained for hours. When she returned, she spoke of her body discorporating into fire and of newly unearthed wisdom, and in this moment, her unit became her first spiritual followers.

Returning to the Sunlight Legion, Aastrika used her newfound prowess and understanding to depose the leadership that sent her to her death. She then claimed her rightful place as warlord and spiritual leader in equal parts, preaching the importance of balance in both.

### Frost Giants

Born of soaring peaks in frigid mountains, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, which they carry like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory.

***Issenblau.*** Where frost giants make their home, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their tongue, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.

### Hill Giants

Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Though most hill giants want to be left in peace, if pressed, one can demolish a small village in minutes.

***Strength and Hierarchy.*** Many evil hill giants respect strength above all. They seek to dominate creatures they perceive as weak, such as ogres and goblins, while bending the knee to creatures stronger than themselves. Other hill giants instead become wardens of their smaller neighbors, driving off bandits and other threats.

***Easily Distracted.*** Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In times of battle, such distractions can draw the hill giant's ire, making them switch from one target to another.

### Stone Giants

Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity.

***Of the Stone.***  Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their home—marble, granite, or even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.

*Put some earth in your mouth. Dirt. Just a little, don't eat it. But if they see you know the ritual, they'll let you pass.*— Lady Demelza, Courser
> ##### Make Players Aware: Distracted
>
>The hill giants' Distracted trait gives player characters an opportunity to have some fun and engage in "Hey, over here!" tactics. But the players only get to have that fun if they know how the trait works, so be sure to share it with them.
>

**Hill Giant Flunky**

**Basalt Stone Giant**

**Granite Stone Giant**

> ##### Many Stones, One Band
>
>Stone giants made of different rocks ally with each other in times of war. These giants understand that their skills in battle complement one another. Marble giants wade into battle alongside basalt and granite giants. In times of peace, different stone giant groups share new secrets of rune magic and trade with one another.
>
>This may leave you wanting more stone giants than the three in this book. You can create new stone giant stat blocks by taking a non-stone giant stat block from this section, giving it the stone giant's False Appearance and Stone Flesh traits, and giving it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from mundane attacks that aren't adamantine. Then pick a type of stone you think fits the new stat block, and you're done! For instance, you could modify the **fire giant red fist** to create an obsidian giant, or you could use the **frost giant wind sprinter** to make a zircon giant.
>

**Marble Stone Giant**

> ##### Giant Lairs
>
>Giant lairs are filled with clothing, furniture, tools, weapons, and even treasure that is sized for beings over 15 feet tall. The inside of a giant's lair should make the players feel as though their characters have shrunk as they navigate familiar setups, such as a mead hall, from a new perspective. Normally trivial activities, like grabbing an amulet off a table, become herculean tasks that require planning, preparation, and risk of bodily harm! This change of pace is fantastic fun.
>
>You can use the following guidelines to help you create challenges in a giant's lair.
>
>- **Ceilings.** The ceilings in a giant's lair should be at least 20 feet high to allow the giant plenty of space to move around without needing to squeeze.
>- **Climbing Furniture.** A character can climb a piece of furniture in a giant's lair with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
>- **Doorways and Halls.** The doorways and halls in a giant's lair should be at least 15 feet wide so the giant can comfortably move down the halls without squeezing. If multiple giants live in the lair, consider making the halls even wider to accommodate multiple giants at once. Likewise, doorways should be at least 15 feet tall.
>- **Giant Potions.** Giant-sized potions have the same amount of magic in a greater amount of liquid. A Medium or smaller creature must use three actions to consume the potion. The potion takes effect after the third action is used to consume it. If more than 1 minute passes between actions used to consume the potion, the potion loses its magic and has no effect.
>- **Giant Scrolls.** A scroll must be unrolled before it can be read. A Medium or smaller creature can unroll a giant-sized scroll as an action.
>- **Object Dimensions and Weights.** Objects sized for giants have dimensions that are typically two to three times the size of the human equivalent and weigh about eight times as much. Using encumbrance rules in giant lairs helps the characters figure out how many of a frost giant jarl's gold busts they can carry.
>- **Opening Doors.** Large, Medium, and Small creatures can open a door in a giant's lair as an action. Tiny creatures can't open the doors. If the door is latched or locked, the latch or lock is 10 feet above the floor. A Medium or smaller character can climb up to it with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check.
>- **Stairs.** Stairs in giant lairs count as difficult terrain for Medium and smaller creatures.
>- **Traps.** Giants often craft traps meant to keep out other enemy giants as well as smaller folk. As such, their traps often affect larger areas. Their flame jets shoot wider and higher than humanoid traps, their pits are deeper, and their scythes cut at multiple heights.

## Gibbering Mouthers

*It's difficult to describe what a gibbering mouther looks like, but you'll know when you see one.*— An Adventurer's Guide to AberrationsGibbering mouthers are chaos incarnate. When these denizens of the ever-changing plane of Primordius travel, they take a piece of home with them. Reality bends to their will. The ground bubbles beneath them, gravity rearranges around them, and adventurers either run from them or are sucked into the chaos.

***Taxing Taxonomy.*** Gibbering mouthers wriggle as a mess of ever-shifting body parts. Their name was coined by an explorer who described seeing—and fleeing from—"a heaping pile of babbling mouths speaking in languages known and unknown." Other adventurers have reported similar amalgamations of bones, muscles and limbs, each more horrifying than the last. Only recently did sages discover these creatures shared the same chaotic ancestry, though their appearance is so in flux that they can't be perceived the same way twice.

***Chaos Gourmets.*** The gibbering mouther subsists on change the same way most creatures subsist on food and water. A gibbering mouther can treat themself to a feast just by finding their way to the Mundane World, where things are deliciously mutable. Though they can't make the trip on their own, gibbering mouthers seize any opportunity they can to travel, sneaking through mage portals and interdimensional rifts caused by wild magic. Some are summoned to the Mundane World by particularly malevolent forces, like zealous cultists, megalomaniacal mages, and others wanting to change or distract the world.

***Unconscionable Transformation.*** Living beings are especially susceptible to the reality-bending influence of the gibbering mouther. Those exposed to one of these creatures often return with a souvenir: an altered body. At first these effects are minor—their body might steadily flicker in and out of reality, or their face might sprout an additional nose. These effects always worsen, adding and rearranging body parts over time. Eventually, those who can't find supernatural help are transformed into gibbering mouthers themselves, roaming the Mundane World in search of a slice of reality to shift.

***Gibbering Friend.*** On rare occasion, a gibbering mouther finds an adventurer who embodies chaos. Such a pairing can bring about an unlikely friendship; the gibbering mouther happily serves as a stalwart companion as long as their caretaker provides plenty of opportunities to warp reality. In even more unique circumstances, an adventurer turned into a gibbering mouther might resist the call of chaos and remain with their party.

## Gnolls

Gnolls aren't humanoids, but hyena-faced fiends—created by a dead demon lord, they carry his evil legacy wherever they roam. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll's muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. The pack's eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.

***Born from Blood.*** The Abyssal Wasteland is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amidst its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas—bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of these predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As'sylrak the Warper. As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends "gnoll," an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is "to consume completely." And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.

***Ceaseless Hunger.*** The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn't receive As'sylrak's blessing; these tagalongs enjoy the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh—and they hunger for more, longing for a day when gnolls hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.

***Gnoll War.*** Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren't choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.

> ##### Ravening Horde or Clever Killers?
>
>Gnoll enemies in your game might be a horde of demonic soldiers who charge wildly into battle, fight the first foe they see to the death, then move on to the next victim. In this case, a gnoll has little care for their own safety, let alone the protection of their allies, as they wade into the fray full of bloodlust. This strategy works well for an overwhelming number of gnolls fighting together and gives your players the sense that their characters are standing against a relentless horde.
>
>You could also make gnoll villains more calculated in their approach to violence. A smaller band of gnolls might employ clever tactics, waiting until night to sneak up on the characters, starting fires to cover their escape, and focusing their fire on enemies who threaten their victory the most. These gnolls work together in a cohesive group with fiendish cunning.
>

### Abyssal Hyenas

Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.

### Tusker Demons

Towering among a gnoll war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although tuskers usually follow gnoll commands, when they grow especially hungry for souls, they charge forward without regard to the allies they may trample.

>
>Many gnolls don't mind using a cursed magic item if it conveys some benefit to them as well, like a *berserker axe* or *demon armor*. They also like to use magic items that allow them to destroy swaths of enemies and objects, like a *bead of force* or a *spell scroll* of *shatter*.
>
>Gnolls value any items that improve their offensive capabilities, using any magic weapon or vial of *oil of sharpness* they can get their hands on. If the item deals damage or makes someone more likely to hit with an attack, then a gnoll wants to use it no matter the object's origin.
>

**Gnoll Marauder**

> ##### Gnoll Laughter
>
>Like hyenas, gnolls make a sound akin to human giggling when they face danger. When this sound comes on the wind in the darkness of night, it can be a chilling warning that precedes a gnoll raid.

You could also find a video of a hyena laughing online and play it for them.

*"Gnoll" is a shortened form of their endonym Gnol'sylrak, meaning "Children of As'sylrak." As'sylrak held the title of Archion of the Cult of the Black Star when he died, and he passed his immortal hate of all things with souls on to his children.*— Remainer
## Goblins

Like all humanoid ancestries, there are many different goblins and goblin cultures, each with their own ideals. Known to themselves as *rogabrin*, meaning "more of us" in their language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoids in the world. They can be found in every environment humans occupy and places many others avoid, like deep cave systems.

Their proportionally long arms and prehensile toes make them equally well adapted to arboreal environments. Goblins live comfortably in treetop cities and subterranean environments with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. Others prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods of diverse cities.

Those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of the bunch, thieves and murderers shunned by their own people and driven to live on society's outskirts.

***Encountered in Groups.*** In society and in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely (and perhaps overly) confident. Such groups often become bandits that ambush travelers in their territories, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands may become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they're encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and flee when foes outnumber friends.

> ##### Content Warning: Spiders
>
>War spiders are really big spiders! If you or any players in your group don't enjoy descriptions of skittering spiders, you don't need to go into detail while narrating scenes with the creature. You could also turn the war spider into another creature, like a war lizard with sticky saliva.
>

***Mobile and Sneaky.*** Short, lithe, and long-armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who survive life in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies' knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.

***Goblin Magic.*** Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities—archfey, deities, fiends—for magic power. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.

### Skitterling

A six-legged, winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, appearing to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary blindness.

### War Spider

Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. The war spider's bladed legs skitter over enemy forces, while archers fire from atop a platform on the beast's back. During raids, the spider flicks their abdomen to launch warriors off their back into the fray.

### Skitterling

Queen Bargnot, Scourge of the High Road, leads the Jagged Edge Goblins in pillaging caravans. Before her rise, the goblins struggled, attacking only the weakest travelers in unorganized strikes. When she killed her boss and became the band's self-proclaimed queen, everything changed.

The Jagged Edges dug a sprawling network of tunnels in the soft earth beneath the High Road. Secret entrances allow the goblins to make coordinated strikes and disappear before their victims can organize against them. When not planning a raid, Queen Bargnot's warriors train, rewarding the best and punishing the lazy.

Queen Bargnot surrounds herself with warriors. She initially wades into battle with them, then moves back when half her hit points remain to command from safety.

**Goblin Assassin**

> ##### Goblins and Magic Items
>
>Goblin bandits sometimes plunder magic items that aid in their profession. Quick and nimble, goblins benefit from magic items that enhance their other abilities, like a *headband of intellect* or a *potion of giant strength*. Items that grant new powers, such as a *broom of flying* or a *ring of telekinesis*, make for memorable, surprising goblin encounters. Goblins lucky enough to have a stash of *potions of healing* often include a *potion of poison* among them to punish greedy thieves.

Goblins who fight at range climb for better sightlines and defense.

**Worg Companion**

## Griffons

With the head, front legs, and wings of an eagle and the powerful body and haunches of a lion, the griffon hunts anything they desire—even other predators—though they prefer to eat birds, fish, and herd animals. Griffons sometimes misjudge their prey and attack humanoids passing through their mountain or forest territories. They also fiercely defend themselves against anyone who threatens or gets too close to their nests.

***Coveted Mounts.*** Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.

Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by griffon beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.

***Inaccessible Aeries.***  Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can't fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for several months in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then they remain in or near the nest as their parents feed the rapidly growing flightless chick. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly—and after that, it's only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.

***Rare Breeds.*** Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety and a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety. The latter only feeds on carrion, and experts continue to debate whether they should be considered a true griffon or if they deserve their own categorization. Many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can return with evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.

## Hags

When fear of death or hunger for power grips a mortal (often a druid, warlock, or witch), they might forge a pact with unseelie archfey. The mortal becomes a hag—aged, clawed, and cruel—a powerful representative of the unseelie in the Mundane World. In exchange, hags use their magic to bring about the misery that evil archfey crave.

***Hiding in Plain Sight.*** Though hags typically appear as older humanoid women, their true form is as vicious and nasty as their nature. They prefer to show the world a charitable face, but the general wisdom concerning hags is that the more beautiful their appearance, the deeper the rot within. However, this theory has never been confirmed, as few who see a hag's true form live to tell the tale.

***Dealmakers and Heart-Breakers.*** Since old age can't kill hags, the oldest among them accumulate as much knowledge, magic, and repute as ancient dragons. They are happy to share their wares . . . for the right price. Rather than ask for paltry coin, a hag usually bargains for something dear to the customer—perhaps their ability to love, the sound of their child's laugh, or their left pinky toe.

Adding insult to injury, those who deal with hags almost always discover the product is worse than advertised. Mortals should pay close attention to the precise wording of their agreements, lest they end up with a hex they thought would be a gift. Such curses often lead to the corruption of good but desperate folk, and some get so twisted up in fey deals that they become hags themselves.

***What's in a Name?*** Hags give themselves whimsical names, and older hags often select monikers like Auntie, Granny, or Nanny. Such relatable names help entice their favorite prey: the innocent. Who would fear Granny Gumdrops or Auntie Twothumbs?

***Collaboration and Covens.*** Hags are often viewed as solitary beings due to their foul tempers and tempestuous natures, but they aren't opposed to dealing with others when it suits their needs. Green hags form close relationships with local forest beings, night hags cavort with deal-loving devils, and sea hags bargain with other denizens of the deep to keep merfolk away from their lairs. The most infamous hag collaborations are covens, formed when three hags like—or at least tolerate—each other very much and choose to spend a life together.

Due to their preferred lairs and varying ambitions, hags typically work with hags of the same kind, though mixed covens aren't out of the question. While in a coven, hags share magic energy, increasing the power of each member of the coven.

***Loyal Underlings.*** Hags are treacherous by nature, and they only recruit creatures they trust to be loyal underlings. Most of these creatures lack sapience (such as animals, constructs, and undead), though hags sometimes command weaker fey who are too scared to betray them.

### Shtriga Nonna

Shtriga Nonna loves cats, cooking, and not much else. This ancient hag has lived high atop her snowy mountain for time beyond even the memory of most other hags. Shtriga Nonna is unique among her kind—she isn't of the forest, the night, or the sea, and the hag insists she has no need of sisters . . . at least, not anymore.

Rumors abound that she ate her former coven, and there's every reason to believe these stories are true. Shtriga Nonna enjoys dining on the flesh of any creature, especially if it's marinated with the fear and sadness born from making several bad deals with a hag.

Shtriga Nonna can look like anyone, so her victims fear everyone. Many swear she's a massive woman with claws of rusted iron. Others say she's a cat who steals the souls of the sleeping, and some describe her as a beautiful woman cooking tender meat pies.

The hag lives inside a mobile hut that walks through the snowy mountains on giant cat paws. This cozy shack appears inviting on the outside, especially its porch where she has tea with desperate souls who climb the mountain to make a deal. The interior of her home, which is much larger than the outside suggests, betrays her true nature. It's a cluttered, filthy place of wicked cats and cruel instruments for carving flesh.

**Sea Hag Apprentice**

*No! They're not just old women who live in the wood. They don't even look like humans. Well, some of them do. Look, if you see an old woman in the forest and she's grumpy and sarcastic, that's a witch. If she smiles sweetly and offers you a treat, run.*— Pinna, Hedge Witch, Gravesford
## Harpies

*Their song may sound mournful, but they know no guilt for what they do.*— Captain Longrock of the *Starcaller* crewDespite their monstrous nature, harpies cast an angelic silhouette. Each resembles a winged human adorned with feathers along their back, waist, and chest. Instead of hands, they sport arm-wings, and below their knees, their legs end in birdlike talons. Their song, more beautiful than any worldly music, can fool its hearers into believing they've encountered a divine messenger. Harpies delight in luring such victims to their demise or carrying them off to distant roosts to be devoured.

***Dangerous Terrain.*** Harpies prefer to live in treacherous lands, often settling atop dangerous mountain ranges or on rocky shores. By singing near waterfalls, sharp rocks, or the dens of other monsters, a harpy allows the environment to do their killing—and if another predator makes the kill, the harpy always shares the spoils. When the deed is done, the harpy feasts while claiming any particularly shiny baubles their meal carried.

***Flock Together.*** Harpies live in flocks of a dozen or more. The strongest few earn the right to devour victims first, leaving bones for the rest. These weaker, starving harpies can only enhance the songs of others and can't perform a luring melody on their own.

***Giant Meals.*** Harpies often occupy the same rocky, hazardous territories as giants. If a harpy goes for a long time without a meal, they attempt to lure a giant to their death. When this risky strategy works, a harpy flock can eat for weeks.

>
>Some harpy nests have provided so many meals to a shambling mound that they can interact with the plant without danger. The mound becomes an enormous pet that protects the nest and even shares meals by spewing out half-digested victims from their engulfing sack for the harpies to feast upon.

## Hellhounds

*Everyone asks if good dogs go to the heavens. Naive fools! They should be wondering what happens to the bad ones.*— Ek-Boshek of AzmekidomAnyone can see that hellhounds are no ordinary beasts. Larger than most mortal hounds, their eyes glow a vicious scarlet, and their skin ranges from coal-black to blood-red. When angered—which is the vast majority of the time—their skin radiates the hellfire held within, and flames lick at the edges of their mouths, seeking release.

Hellhounds make for fierce and cunning combatants, working well with their owner and pack mates to surround foes. They drive prey into ambushes to maximize the impact of their fiery breath. Not only are these hounds immune to fire, but exposure to it hardens their skin, so they gladly unleash their breath weapons regardless of whether their pack mates are in the line of fire.

Though hellhounds can survive in most environments, they shun the cold and thrive in hot regions such as heated caves, volcanoes, deserts, and sites near rifts to the elemental plane of Quintessence.

***Bound to Serve.*** Fiends create hellhounds from the souls of canines and similar loyal creatures. These fiends often give these hellhounds as rewards to faithful followers—and sometimes to ones who are as yet unproven, but show great potential.

***Drawn to Power.*** Hellhounds tear the unworthy to shreds, but they show great loyalty and even tenderness to capable leaders who treat them well. Thus it's unsurprising that hellhounds thrive under a powerful trainer. Fiends, fire giants, efreet, salamanders, and similar creatures commonly command their respect; in particular, fire giants often form lasting and loyal relationships with their hounds.

***Bent on Destruction.*** Without the steady hand of their trainer, hellhounds become more chaotic and destructive. Like a bad dog left alone, they lay ruin to anything and anyone they can bite or set aflame.

***Redemption.***  Though most hellhounds are formed from the souls of beasts, fiends sometimes sadistically bind fallen humanoid souls that were once good people but lost their way, forcing them to serve as hellhounds. In rare cases, such a hound can be redeemed if rescued at a young age by a kind and capable trainer who can lead the hound on a gentler path. Upon its death, a redeemed hellhound is freed from the Seven Cities of Hell and moves on to a better afterlife.

## Hobgoblins

Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks, and one or more horns protrude from their head.

Like other humanoids, hobgoblins have no special inclination toward conquest, battle, or cruelty, and they can be found in all walks of life. But when the wicked among them fall on desperate times, some use their talents for the violence and subjugation of others.

***Synergized Tactics.*** Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies are often second to none.

### Grilp

The grilp—a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat—can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond these covert skills, however, hobgoblins value grilps most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which makes other creatures vulnerable to fire and necrotic damage.

### Slaughter Demon

When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a *grack'tanar*, known as a slaughter demon in the Common tongue. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.

Devils captured the grack'tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Their archdevil captors reward loyal hobgoblins by allowing the mortals to hold a grack'tanar's reins for a time. These slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe.

### Bloodlord Varrox

The brilliant tactician Varrox traces his lineage to the first goblin who made an infernal bargain to become a hobgoblin. Varrox's mother, the great bloodlord Fanoxa, raised him right alongside her army. The only home Varrox has ever known was a war camp, and his upbringing was conquest and bloodshed. When he witnessed her defeat and capture at the Battle of Redfields, he vowed to die an even greater conqueror.

The warlord enthusiastically embraces his legacy, seeking more power by forging deals with devils. These fiends demand Varrox capture more territory, which the devils then offer to greedy nobles in exchange for their souls and service.

Varrox encourages his troops to forge infernal deals for more power, and he keeps them on a strict training regimen so they might better wreak havoc. While on a battlefield, he expects tactical precision and sacrifice. The archfiends who treat with Varrox credit him with every pact his troops forge, granting him a little more might with every contract signed.

The devils of the Seven Cities of Hell have plans for Varrox. Once the hobgoblin amasses enough troops, they plan to send Varrox and his army out into the timescape to conquer peaceful worlds, some of which have no armies. For throwing a world into peril creates desperate souls—souls far more likely to make a deal with a devil.

***Camp Firefield.*** Varrox and his vanguard travel with a magical tent that was gifted to the hobgoblin by an archdevil. The tent contains the rest of his forces—when its stakes are set into the ground, the tent flaps open into Camp Firefield, a multilevel demiplane where Varrox's forces prepare for conquest.

> ##### Blood-Infused Weapons
>
>Many hobgoblin smiths individualize weapons for each soldier, using a drop of the warrior's blood during the item's creation. When a hobgoblin wields a weapon forged with their own blood, it harnesses their innate magic. Such weapons can light ablaze or ripple with negative energy, dealing additional fire or necrotic damage (already included in the stat blocks).
>
>If another creature tries to wield a blood-infused weapon, it functions merely as a weapon without these extra damaging properties. At the GM's discretion, a blood-infused weapon wielded by another creature can deal its extra damage for the next 1d4 attacks made with that weapon. After its power is expended in that way, the vweapon ceases to deal extra damage for any creature other than its original hobgoblin owner.

> ##### Hobgoblin Magic Items
>
>Hobgoblins already use blood-infused weapons, so they tend to seek out items that can improve their defensive capabilities, such as *adamantine armor* or an *animated shield*. They value loyalty and employ items that can conjure obedient allies, like a *figurine of wondrous power* or a *spell scroll* of *conjure elemental*. Many hobgoblin captains understand the strategic importance of taking prisoners, so they might employ *iron bands of binding* or even an *iron flask* for those particularly powerful and extraplanar foes.

## Humans

*First a guard tower—say, five leagues in. That'll draw the orcs and elves and every other stinking thing that hides in the wode. And while they're fighting us over the tower, we clear the forest. Cut down everything from here to the tower. Make a path, then a road, use the felled trees for our homes. Soon, this whole forest will be green fields and farms. It'll be ours.*— Baron UthrakHumans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.

***Villains and Heroes.*** Recognizing their limited lifespan, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes their names will be remembered forever.

Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more by the sword. Others turn to theft, often driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons—both exact a toll.

Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek dark desires in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.

Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.

***Risks and Rewards.*** Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive training explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment—knowing when to risk it all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent's mistakes and seize the advantage.

Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village or an ancient dungeon yielding a chest full of coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it's a game worth playing.

Swords for Hire. With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally . . . if you can afford their price.

### Baron Uthrak

Even as a young adventurer, Wigar Uthrak was known for his derring-do, formidable swordplay, and cutthroat leadership. He soon gathered a team of like-minded scoundrels, rising from bandit chief to mercenary captain. After winning the favor of a monarch, he was titled baron.

However, Baron Uthrak gambled poorly when he backed the monarch's younger brother in a failed rebellion. Stripped of his lands, the exiled baron now abides in the wild with his crew of miscreants, knavish ex-knights, and wielders of forbidden magic.

The consummate opportunist, Uthrak patiently stokes his war band's loyalty while awaiting a suitable power vacuum, set on establishing a new barony and increasing his dominion. Uthrak may even orchestrate such a vacuum himself, perhaps by helping naive adventurers do away with a stronger rival.

Baron Uthrak keeps his most loyal lieutenants close to him. He usually hides a contingent of guards and trickshots within earshot, ready to ambush any who displease him. He fights on the front lines of battle, trusting his magic sword, *Nine Lives*, to protect him. It has already saved his life six times, and Uthrak believes he can't die until the sword's magic is fully spent.

Likewise, magic items that have a property that triggers on an attack roll of 20, such as a *vicious weapon* or a *vorpal sword*, have a better chance of doing their cool thing when combined with Exploit Opening. Make sure your players like a deadly game before equipping a villain with a *vorpal sword*, since one lucky strike will cost a hero their head!

## Kingfissure Worms

*"That's just four of us against the beast," remarked the youth bearing a sword twice his size. "And Jadis is the only one of us who's a proper worm hunter."*

*"There are no kingfissure worm hunters," snapped Jadis Mara, "only prey who refused to be swallowed."*Named for their infamous hunting technique, kingfissure worms terraform the earth as they move, building tunnels and crevasses to accommodate their enormous form. They then lie in wait deep underground. When they sense the vibrations of their prey above, they shoot their serpentine tongues through the crevasses, dragging prey from the surface into the worm's cavernous maw. Seasoned adventurers know to be wary when traveling past even the smallest crack in the earth.

***Intestine Inventory.*** The worm eats indiscriminately, swallowing creatures, structures, and precious gems alike. The wealth inside a kingfissure worm would put any dragon's hoard to shame, though the worm cares nothing for treasure and knows nothing of the spoils lodged in their labyrinthine intestines. Few people have seen the inside of a kingfissure worm and lived, but those who do usually escape with a precious souvenir or two.

***Home Renovators.*** Most worms build a den of tunnels and fissures, remaining in it for as long as the pickings on the surface are good and they aren't disturbed. When a kingfissure worm seeks a new home, they target areas with abundant food—occasionally leading to villagers waking up to find their surrounding lands have been terraformed overnight. Residents of such lands generally have two choices: pack up and leave, or prepare for battle. If a worm is somehow defeated, all manner of creatures and communities try to lay claim to the worm's underground structures. These empty dens make wonderful war bunkers, isolated workshops, and even highly defensible villages.

***Unstoppable Force.*** The kingfissure worm is a species determined to outrun, outlast, and out-eat every other living creature. Though the monster might be slowed by a display of great power, only death stops them. Some scholars theorize that when a kingfissure worm dies, their tongues detach and grow into full-fledged worms.

***Unlikely Symbiosis.*** Some nomadic communities or adventurers travel dangerous lands with the help of an unusual guardian—a juvenile kingfissure worm. So long as the people provide a steady supply of food for the worm, the kingfissure follows dutifully. And if the people attract monsters from above, the worm defends their companions while enjoying an extra meal.

## Kobolds

Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry centurion, they pose a significant threat.

***Defensive Masters.*** In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary; every warrior carries a shield into battle, and soldiers defend each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold's shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.

Kobold legionaries may join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.

***Unconventional Tactics.*** Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn't take them seriously. Their foes haven't experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy mechanical dragons and flaming spike pit traps.

Tiny Dragons. Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons—and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant chromatic, metallic, or crystalline scales; as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives under the patronage of a dragon adopts the color of their patron's scales over several generations.

### Shieldscale Drangolin

Kobolds train drangolins—draconic pangolins—to dig residential tunnel networks and neutralize enemy fortifications. While drangolins can curl into balls and smash through obstacles, kobold tacticians prefer to go under walls instead of through them. After burrowing, the drangolin erupts into the center of an enemy camp, then kobold legionaries pour out through the tunnel.

***Made of Shields.*** Kobold legions decorate their drangolin's scales to match their own shields' designs, and warriors consider it a good omen when the scale they painted blocks a blow. When a drangolin loses a scale in battle, it's gifted to a warrior to serve as their shield.

> ##### Deadly Kobolds!
>
>The kobolds in this book are built to work together. We found out during playtesting that they worked a little too well together after these little lizards murdered several dozen player characters. As a result, we reduced the power of the kobolds quite a bit, but a squad of these small dragons is still a formidable force against squishy 1st-level characters. One unlucky critical hit against a 1st-level wizard spells that hero's doom.
>
>When employing these kobolds against a 1st-level party, use the kobolds with a challenge rating of 1 or lower (unless you're looking to make things deadly). Save the artifex and shieldscale dragonlin for the next adventure! We also recommend using no more non-minion kobolds than there are characters in a single encounter. If you want 1st-level characters battling it out against an entire kobold legion, that's what the tiro is for.

**Kobold Adeptus**

**Kobold Artifex**

> ##### Running an Artifex
>
>The artifex's shenanigans are more believable if they're waiting at the battlefield when the characters arrive—the idea is that the artifex is triggering traps they have already set. How they trigger traps is up to you. They could throw their chain hook to pull hidden levers, use a wand or mechanical contraption, or even yell commands to other kobolds toiling in tunnels under the battlefield.
>
>You can increase an encounter's difficulty by giving the artifex allies who can push characters into the traps, or by staging the combat in tight quarters so the traps are more likely to hit multiple characters.
>
>You can decrease an encounter's difficulty by reducing the size of the traps, by placing the traps in predetermined areas and letting characters make ability checks to detect them, or by staging the combat in an open area where the characters can spread out.
>
>If the characters dare to challenge a kobold legion in their own lair, an artifex makes an excellent leader of the defense. Give the artifex a way of seeing throughout the lair, such as a network of mirrors, and let them trigger traps anywhere within the lair.
>
>Lairs let you deploy traps that wouldn't make sense in open combat, such as:
>
>- A tripwire that sends a boulder rolling down the hallway.
>- A tightrope over a lava pool and a concealed kobold on the other side waiting to cut the rope.
>- A pool of blood that conceals a few **blood-borne ooze**s (see "Graveyard and Tomb" in chapter 2, "Environments").
>- Maze-like corridors and moving false walls that disorient the characters and lead them toward an ambush.

**Kobold Centurion**

*Individually they're nowhere near as tough as goblins, but as a group? It's just a major, major headache. Better to treat with them. Flatter them. They like that. Tell 'em you like dragons—that usually works.*— The Sun, Senior Pyrokinetic, The Society**Kobold Legionary**

**Kobold Signifer**

> ##### Upholding High Standards
>
>No legion would let their glorious standard lie trampled beneath the boots of their enemies. When a signifer dies, the nearest tiro races to the body to pick up the signum. If an enemy picks up the signum or harms it, the kobolds focus their attacks on that creature.

>
>While many epic heroes carry weapons of legend into battle, a kobold champion's shield is almost as famous as the warrior wielding it. Kobolds who wield magic shields are typically warriors of great renown who are known across the land.

## Lightbenders

Lightbenders prowl deserts, plains, forests—any sunbathed wilderness. Their adaptations make them skilled daylight predators. This monstrous creature's fur bends and refracts light from the surrounding environment, producing mirages that distract and confuse their prey—hence their name.

***Hidden Hunters.*** At a distance, a lightbender looks akin to a regular lion, but closer inspection reveals their glowing eyes, iridescent mane, and pair of lashing tails spiked with refractive crystals. The lightbender's pelt magically warps light around them to disguise their movement, allowing them to teleport while leaving behind a past visual imprint. Unsuspecting prey rarely realize they're staring at an afterimage of the lightbender until the fearsome creature pounces.

***Prized Manes.*** Both male and female lightbenders have the distinctive mane, which is highly prized for its light-displacing qualities and can be fashioned into a mantle of the lightbender, though only a few mages possess the knowledge to do so.

***Protective Companions.*** Though lightbenders are typically solitary creatures, they sometimes cross into another lightbender's territory to help protect a newborn litter of kittens. A few people have succeeded in taming lightbenders as guards or hunting animals, and if treated well, they can make for loyal protectors, often viewing their smaller humanoid companions as surrogate kittens.

*Mantle of the Lightbender*

> ##### Who Are You Wearing?
>
>A lightbender can become enraged in the presence of a creature wearing the *mantle of the lightbender* and attack mercilessly. Lightbender companions often refuse to adventure with characters who wear such a magic item. At the GM's discretion, the mane of a lightbender companion can't be used to create a mantle—in part because the companion's life among other creatures leaves them with a smaller mane, and in part because this prevents adventurers from hacking their friend to pieces.

## Lizardfolk

Lizardfolk prefer warm, tropical climes, but they're willing to settle in any humid region—the more moisture in the air, the better. Even in colder climates, lizardfolk can be found in any sufficiently marshy environment. Bogs and wetlands are favorites.

Their scales protect both against weapons and the moisture in their native environments. Coloring and hue vary wildly with environment and diet.

Lizardfolk aren't especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened—which they often feel, because it often is. But for respectful travelers, entering lizardfolk territory need be no great hardship. Lizardfolk cultures often take up a specific trade, like boatmaking, fletching, weaving, or navigating, and they sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places.

***Homeland Protectors.*** Adventurers cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in caverns and abandoned ruins for protection. Treasure-seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins.

***Focused and Loyal.*** Most lizardfolk speak plainly, viewing blunt honesty as a sign of respect. When they make a vow or personal promise, they do all they can to honor that word. Lizardfolk who swear to destroy an enemy follow their quarry to the ends of the earth.

***Marshland Tyrants.*** In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory. But there are always other local lizardfolk tribes who oppose such aggressive, expansionist posturing; they often seek the aid of others who value freedom from tyranny.

**Lizardfolk Bloodeye**

> ##### Lizardfolk Tactics
>
>Lizardfolk prefer to take on enemies in the water, since their swimming speed and Amphibious trait give them the upper hand against enemies without those traits. Bloodeyes, grunts, and scaletooths grapple or restrain enemies to keep them underwater, while terrorsaurs patrol above the surface, hunting any foe who dares to escape.

**Lizardfolk Scaletooth**

**Lizardfolk Terrorsaur**

*They shed their tails! So cool! Of course then everyone wants lizardfolk tails as spell ingredients—that's not so cool. It doesn't even do anything!*— Pinna, Hedge Witch, Gravesford
> ##### Real-World Inspiration
>
>Many of the lizardfolk traits and actions are inspired by real-world lizard anatomy. For instance, the horned lizard shoots blood from its eyes when threatened, inspiring the lizardfolk bloodeye's Bloodeye Bolt action. The draco lizard has ribs connected by folds of skin that can extend and retract, forming wings that allow them to glide from tree to tree. The terrorsaur takes inspiration from the draco lizard.
>

**Lizardfolk Hunter**

## Manticores

A weary traveler hears a clarion call through the forest or friendly voices from a rocky shelter, and their heart leaps at the promise of refuge—only to find themself at the mercy of serrated teeth and poisoned spikes. In a manticore's territory, people go missing without a trace. These fearsome creatures carve out their hunting grounds in forests near small villages, mountain passes where caravans travel, and other locations with plentiful wildlife. While manticores can subsist on a carnivorous diet of any nearby prey, their choicest meal is humanoid flesh.

***Uncanny Appearances.*** A manticore has a lion's body, a dragon's wings, and a scorpion's tail barbed with spines, but their most unnerving trait is their humanoid face. Owing to a quirk of magical evolution, manticores develop the features of common mortal lineages that populate their region of birth. For example, a manticore in an area densely populated by tieflings inherits fiendish eyes and devilish horns. Manticores are born with an inherent understanding of a regional language, but they can speak only through mimicking that which they've heard—a talent manticores use to lure in prey.

***Heralds of Death.*** Manticores have a magical howl like a trumpet. This haunting sound not only terrifies creatures, but makes them more susceptible to the manticore's bite. While on the hunt, manticores often take to the skies, shooting poison-tipped spikes from their tail to weaken their victims before howling and closing in.

***Ferocious Companions.*** A manticore who develops a taste for humanoids can rarely be tamed. But a young manticore who has yet to cut their teeth on such flesh can be raised into a fearsome ally. After a trained manticore companion finally tastes delicious humanoid flesh, they typically remain loyal to their caregiver.

For the duration, a creature who touches you or hits you with a melee attack takes 5 (1d10) piercing damage, and they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your exploit save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Medusas

Hunted as monsters with no thought given to their nature or origin, few creatures are as underestimated and misunderstood as medusas. Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god—but while some medusas embrace wickedness, others simply fight for their lives against ignorant hunters.

***Cursed for Defiance.*** When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, the deity may curse them to live as a medusa. The offender's skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.

The gods who use this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude—or to places haunted by creatures who don't judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories.

***Warriors for Good or Ill.*** Though they might be secluded, medusas rarely stay idle. Many plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of victims who foolishly hunted or harmed them.

***Serpentine Reflexes.*** While the medusa's stone gaze is legendary, they also can move and strike as swiftly as a snake. This enhanced dexterity makes them incredible archers, and most prefer to fight at range.

***Lifting the Curse.*** The deity who inflicted a medusa's curse can rarely be convinced to lift the punishment, usually by undertaking an impossible task in the god's name or making a threat they can't ignore. Some sages claim ancient rituals can undo a god's curse, but these lost secrets are hidden by wrathful divine servants—and performing such a ritual would almost certainly entail great sacrifice.

### Medusa Lairs

Medusas find privacy and solace in the shadows, often occupying abandoned ruins in lonely mountains or caves with lofty ceilings. Statues of a medusa's victims usually litter the area.

### Lady Emer

When Lady Emer was human, she excelled as a scout in the mercenary Order of the Ouroboros. As her fame grew, she openly proclaimed that one day she would ascend to godhood. Emer hired bards to sing of her inevitable rise to the heavens, and their words reached the ears of the gods. Those lyrics damned Emer—but she saw her transformation not as a curse, but as an advantage, and her ambitions grew.

The leaders of the Order of the Ouroboros accepted Emer's new form as a unique opportunity. She secretly serves the order as an assassin, though most members don't realize it. The order pays her and she gets the job done, no questions asked. In exchange for her service, the order also allows Emer access to their library. The medusa takes promising tomes back to her lair, where she searches for secrets to help her achieve godhood.

Although Emer lives in an abandoned keep in the high mountains, she maintains it with an eye for modern fashion and elegant comfort. The garden courtyard of her keep boasts a unique collection of statues—targets who needed to disappear but might still be useful someday

The extroverted Lady Emer craves company, but members of her order rarely visit and never stay for long. The medusa is confident that if she were to amass enough power to claim leadership, then she could come out of the shadows and use the order's resources to achieve her divine goals.

**Medusa**

> ##### Medusa Petrification

>At lower levels, the petrified condition can take a character out of the game permanently. If you want to give a low-level character a chance to recover from being petrified after a medusa encounter, make sure there is a temple nearby with a priest who can cast *greater restoration* . . . for a price, of course.

## Mimics

*You could steer clear of abandoned treasure chests, ignore the cries of kittens, and stay out of dark alleys for the rest of your life. Even so, a mimic can ambush you out of the clear blue sky.*— Mimsen Ickus, honorary knight of the Ivy IronsFor the cocky adventurers heedless of danger, a mimic is as deadly as a dragon. These amorphous creatures possess an unmatched ability to disguise themselves as any object, from furniture to treasure. Mimics learn what their victims want and use it to lure prey into their serrated teeth.

A mimic can make their home in any environment. So long as the area has prey and places to hide—among tree branches, along the faults of a cliff, or behind the baubles of a crowded bazaar stall—a mimic can wait for the perfect moment to strike.

***Sticks to You.*** A mimic can make any part of their skin sticky. This allows them to climb most surfaces and attach to unfortunate creatures who touch them, which is why mimics in dungeons often disguise themselves as tempting treasures.

***Panic Shifting.*** When a mimic feels pain, they can quickly compress their body into a dense object, popping a bouquet of boney spikes out of their skin. Threatened mimics can remain in this form indefinitely, and they often use it as a warning sign to predators that they are hard to swallow.

***Mimic Sounds.*** While mimics don't understand language, they can mimic sounds they hear—including human speech. They often cleverly use a former victim's pleas for help to attract would-be heroes as the mimic's latest meal.

***Well-Fed Companions.*** When a mimic's hunger is satisfied, they become docile. Most can wait weeks between meals, sitting patiently in the form of a barrel or rock. If a daring adventurer feeds a mimic until it is docile, the monstrosity may become fond of that hero. They follow and defend this reliable food source, and if the bond grows strong enough, they may even allow the adventurer to wear them like clothing.

Used as Distractions. Spies, thieves, and others who wish to walk into guarded locations unnoticed plant a mimic as a distraction just outside the restricted area they need to enter. The mastermind can slip in during the mimic's initial rampage and then more easily sneak out while the guardians spread thin throughout the complex, poking every vase and floor tile with a halberd to make sure there are no more monstrosities in the area.

***Unseen Assassins.*** Hired killers find a relationship with a mimic can be quite profitable, as the assassin can infiltrate their target's space and leave the shapechanger to do the dirty work. These trained mimics can lie in wait for days, pretending to be a benign chest or wardrobe. There is some risk involved, since the mimic could devour someone other than the intended target, tipping off the real quarry. A panicked mimic might run back to the handler, leading the authorities right to the person responsible. But assassination is risky business!

> ##### Bigger Mimics
>
>While a mimic disguised as a chest or wardrobe is classic fun, you can really shock your players by including enormous mimics that can disguise themselves as buildings. Imagine walking into a tavern for a bite to eat only to have the tavern bite you!
>
>If you want to create a mimic who can polymorph into Huge and Gargantuan objects, make the following adjustments to the mimic stat block:
>
>- The mimic has 91 (14d8 + 28) hit points and a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP).
>- The mimic's Strength score is 20 (+5).
>- The mimic has a +7 bonus to hit with their Pseudopod and Gnashing Maw attacks, and each attack deals an additional 7 (2d6) acid damage.
>- The DC to escape the mimic's grapple and Envelop effect is 15.
>- Shapechanger allows the mimic to turn into any Medium or larger object.

## Minotaurs

Despite their reputation, most minotaurs aren't evil—but all are fearsome. These unusual creatures are a study in contrasts. Their imposing humanoid body is muscular with patches of thick hair. Their head is that of a massive horned bull, and their soft eyes convey a soulful intelligence mingled with smoldering intensity.

***Primal Rage.*** Minotaurs burn with fury. Some constantly desire to unleash this destructive energy on the world, and they attack anyone or anything that crosses their path. Others make it a point of pride to control their rage, only fighting when survival demands it.

Regardless, once combat begins, minotaurs relish charging at foes with their great horns. In the heat of battle, a minotaur charges from one foe to the next, only retreating if victory is entirely impossible.

***Labyrinthine Origins.*** The first minotaur was once the human warrior Thesia "The Bull" Danaria, who dared challenge the Beast Lords of Kham. When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia's mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia's anger—until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love. New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other maze-like terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, a few can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement.

***Deep Bonds.*** Even evil minotaurs can be fiercely loyal friends, gladly charging into certain death for those they trust. These chosen friends never suffer the creature's ire—but gods help them if they betray the minotaur.

## Ogres

Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres still outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life.

***Extreme Emotions.*** Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross; you're more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart's desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.

Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.

***Savory Stories.*** Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories end tragically, each with a different villain—from deceptive mages to talking cats—swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs. The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences.

***Aristocracy of Bullies.*** When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them. These petty rulers make other ogres grovel at their feet for table scraps, then send them out into the world to steal more. Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats—but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends.

## Orcs

In a long-lost language, the word *oruk*—"blood fire"—described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as *kanin* in their own tongue, they also use "orc" with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.

Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They've settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics.

Though orcs are no more likely to stand in the adventurers' way than any other folk, those who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.

***Relentlessly Tough.*** Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they're excited or driven. Their hair, which can range from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.

Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with "blood fire," glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white respectively.

***Innate Power.*** The intense power of an orc's spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc conduits hone their magic into singular affinities that are easy to manipulate. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature's spirit.

### Mohler

Mohlers are spined, pig-like beasts that corkscrew through the ground faster than they can run. Originating from deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface.

Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests—and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield and knock the orcs' enemies off their feet.

***Mohler Companions.*** When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.

### Scyza

Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. Orcs adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride the scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts.

The scyza's trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.

### Dohma Raskovar

Dohma Raskovar is the latest in a long line of leaders—known as dohmas—of the Ivory Throne, a band of mercenaries. Under Raskovar's leadership, the throne has grown to over a hundred strong, and now they handle multiple contracts simultaneously, occasionally banding together to fight as a single unit in battle.

Raskovar runs the throne from the Hanging Tree, his tavern where he plays the role of barkeep. Here, clients in the know can discreetly indicate their desire to hire bounty hunters, cutthroats, or thieves by ordering a boiling oil, a mundane blend of whiskey and rum that appears on no menu.

Once the drink is ordered, Raskovar himself appears at the table, ready to do business. He prides himself on remaining politically neutral and treating all potential customers as equals, something that chafes a few of his clients. Many local nobles have stormed out of the Hanging Tree in a rage after Raskovar refused to use the proper forms of address—only to return later when their situation is more desperate, and pride too costly.

***Life of Luxury.*** Dohma Raskovar enjoys the finer things in life—nice clothes, fine drink, and delicious food. He shares these comforts with members of the Ivory Throne and others he trusts enough to let into the restricted areas of the Hanging Tree.

> ##### Orc Tactics
>
>Orcs charge into battle, keeping foes close so that they can use their Relentless trait when the time comes. Orc blitzers surround as many foes as possible to make the most of their Gnashing Horde trait. Bloodrunners and furies also dive into melee combat, dishing out extra damage to targets they knock prone. Conduits, forcecallers, and terranovas get close to the action but avoid melee. Orc ramparts serve as protectors for these mages battling any who dare challenge the orc spellcasters.
>
>An orc godcaller positions themself at the center of the battle so that they can heal and buff as many allies as possible, preferably with an orc rampart watching their back. Orc garroters enter the battle last to take advantage of the chaos. They typically arrive invisible so they can get advantage on the first Strangle attack they make.

> ##### Knock Them Prone
>
>The bloodrunner, fury, terranova, mohler, and scyza all have features that can knock enemies prone. If the garroter knocks someone unconscious with a Strangle attack, odds are the target winds up prone as well! Knocking targets prone is especially helpful for the bloodrunner and the fury, since they can both deal extra damage to prone targets. These creatures were designed to work together.

> ##### Orc Magic Items
>
>Even more so than other creatures, orcs benefit from magic items that increase their bonuses to attack and damage rolls, such as a *wand of the war mage* or even a simple *+1 weapon*. These items make the orc's Relentless trait more reliable and are good rewards for low-level player characters who defeat them.
>
>Orcs also benefit from magic items that increase their speed and mobility, allowing them to always stay within striking distance of their targets. A *cape of the mountebank* and a *potion of speed* make excellent choices for an orc who wants to keep their enemies close.

>

## Otyughs

Where garbage lingers, an otyugh lurks. These massive lumps of muscle and maw are scavengers with an insatiable hunger for trash. They plod through refuse on three stout legs, using tooth-lined tentacles to feed on decay. If the stench isn't enough to stop a creature in their tracks, the otyugh's infectious bite certainly will. When starved or if their territory is invaded, otyughs don't hesitate to attack other creatures.

***Trash Adaptive.*** Though an otyugh naturally has three legs, three tentacles, and one eyestalk, they can rapidly transform these appendages to better suit their shifting, chaotic environment. Their tentacles can sprout eyes before plunging into a thick garbage pile or become padded feet to navigate treacherous terrain. The otyugh's adaptable limbs also allow them a flexible response to threats, whether by fleeing on many feet or by growing arms for a hunt.

## Overminds

*"Careful, Xorannox," the queen's consort cautioned. "You tread heavily."*

*"Tread heavily? My dear consort," the Tyract's grin twisted, "I never touch the ground."*Formally known by their endonym, vaurath (plural vaurathi), overminds plot and scheme against their chief rivals, the synlirii and the olothec, for control of the World Below.

***Psionic Eyes.*** An overmind is an enormous floating brain with a large central eye surrounded by many smaller embedded eyes. Even more alien, several psionic eyes float within inches of their head, each connected to a small brain that can manifest a unique psionic effect.

***Intelligent Loremasters.*** Like their rivals, overminds are loremasters of supreme intellect. They aren't usually wizards, but they all view the collection of knowledge and arcane sciences as the best tool for ultimate conquest. Overminds are cruel and capricious but enjoy tests of intellectual might. Their one vanity is their unshakable belief in their own intellectual superiority over all others.

***Overmind Lairs.*** Thanks to their innate flight, overminds prefer to build (or rather, have their thralls build) towers with no doors or entrances anywhere near the bottom.

***Rivalries and Negotiations.*** Unlike their rivals, overminds have an intense hatred of their own kind and never work together. However, overminds often enjoy diplomacy with other species, seeking to form alliances and build secret networks of agents throughout the World Below.

***Smelly Eggs.*** Overmind procreation involves one aberration laying a single egg in a slime pool and leaving it behind. When another overmind later detects the distinct smell of the egg, they spray their inseminating fluid into the pool. These actions are compelled by biological necessity, a compulsion even the overminds can't ignore.

Unwitting explorers sometimes accidentally abscond with an egg. If unfertilized, its bearer is likely to attract the attention of other overminds and synlirii that use the eggs in genetic experiments to create psionic creatures. If fertilized, the explorer could find themselves as a newly hatched overmind's first victim.

### Xorannox the Tyract

*"Xorannox!" Lady Dazran exclaimed.*

*"Hahaha! Surprised? You forgot my allies among the drow, I think. You should know better, my lady. Nothing exceeds my Grasp."*Xorannox ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Xorannox.html](ZOR-ah-nocks)) rules as Lord of the White Tower, a multi-level finger of alabaster stone. Commonly known as the Tyract—an ancient Deep Speech word that literally translates as "a king who rules with his teeth"—the overmind indeed consumes those who displease him.

Xorannox is chief of the Grasp, a secret organization made up of deep gnomes, dark elves, and humans. They seek to overthrow the voiceless talkers' great empire and place Xorannox above all, first as king, then as god.

The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Adventurers from the Mundane World may be surprised to discover their deep allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he's delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.

Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. It's just a matter of who stabs who first.

***Eyes Always Shielded.*** Xorannox's psionic might is so great that unlike other overminds, his floating eyes are never without their psionic shield. When he is truly in distress, Xorannox can sacrifice one of his eyes to bolster his resistances.

**Overmind**

*Each satellite eye is capable of operating independently. Vaurathi use them as scouts, sending them miles away to spy on both enemies and allies.*— Remainer**Xorannox**

## Owlbears

Owlbears possess powerful feathered frames, terrible claws, and a violent distrust of other creatures. The world has come to hate the owlbear, and the owlbear despises the world—a fact they violently express to any creature who crosses their path. Owlbears gain the upper hand by pinning their prey between their powerful appendages and massive form, then they mercilessly rip apart trapped victims with their honed natural weapons.

This behemoth of fur and feathers aggressively patrols their territory. They tend to lead a solitary existence, but during mating season, they den as pairs with their bitter broods.

***Relentless Stalker.*** When the sun hangs low at sunset, the owlbear commits to kill. They wander tirelessly for countless miles in search of prey, regardless of the threat that prey might pose to them. They seek to hunt and kill not merely because of hunger or desire to defend their territory, but because of an overwhelming drive to display physical dominance. After a victory, the owlbear drags their victim back to their territory, feeding on flesh and discarding bones in sloven and draggletailed fashion.

***Ravening Beast of Prey.*** Beyond their wanton killing, these monstrosities quickly upset the local food chain when they settle in an area. As they crowd out other apex predators, this soon leads to an overabundance of vermin. And even when they're not on the hunt, owlbears knock down mature trees with their long claws, collecting the wood into massive piles to harvest termite mounds.

***Fierce Companions.*** Despite the owlbear's vicious tendencies, they're naturally wise and intelligent creatures. Owlbears have shown surprising empathy for the grieving and forsaken outcasts who journey into wild places. Taming an owlbear takes a fearless heart and a commitment rivaling the creature's need to kill.

> ##### Wild Shape and Owlbears
>
>Owlbears are awesome. These fluffy, furry, ferocious creatures have captured the hearts of players everywhere. Almost every GM is eventually asked by a player if their character can turn into an owlbear using the druid's Wild Shape class feature or the *polymorph* spell.
>
>The official answer is no. Owlbears are Monstrosities, not Beasts (despite both owls and bears individually being Beasts), so that automatically disqualifies them as an option for the druid's Wild Shape feature and the polymorph spell. But saying no is denying a player a chance to do a cool thing, and doing cool things is a big part of many people's fun with this game. We want to give you the option of saying yes.
>
>If you want to allow a player character to turn into an owlbear using Wild Shape or the polymorph spell, make the following changes to the owlbear stat block:
>
>- The owlbear's Bear Hug action can be used once. The owlbear regains all uses when they finish a long rest.
>- The owlbear's Hulking Rush reaction can be used once. The owlbear regains all uses when they finish a long rest.

*I mean, I think they're adorable. They're so floofy! They like acorns. I wonder, are there catponies or birdlions? Oh! That's a griffon!*— Pinna, Hedge Witch, Gravesford**Owlbear Companion**

## Shambling Mounds

The ground, lush and overgrown, squelches under every footstep. Curtains of menacing vines block the way, and muffled groans echo distantly under the darkening canopy. By the time you realize the ground is moving, it's too late—the shambling mound has taken you.

Found in overgrown swamps, stinking marshes, dense wodes, and dark, damp rainforests, the shambling mound is a wandering mass of vegetation that feeds on everything in their path.

***Hearty Eater.*** As a shambling mound drags their massive form through the undergrowth, they consume any organic matter they pass. When they find a good place to lurk until a meal comes to them, the result is far more satisfying. After a mound engulfs their prey—be they animal or adventurer—the meal-to-be is sealed in a sack of interwoven vines and leaves. The walls of this vegetative chamber release a toxic sap that dissolves the prey inside.

***Verdant Camouflage.*** Rather than slowly chase prey, the shambling mound prefers to drape their form along well-traveled paths. They blend perfectly into their hunting ground, making it easy to seize unsuspecting passersby. A shambling mound in a rainforest may sport vines, ferns, and giant leaves, while another in a swamp engulfs adventurers in massive grasses, moss, and reeds.

***Noxious Origins.*** A shambling mound is most often a byproduct of a nearby evil mage. The nefarious magic of the surrounding land can coalesce into a nocuous creature consumed by hunger. The shambling mound knows only that they must feed, and thus they drag themself in search of a hunting ground.

***Growing in Size.*** Most shambling mounds begin their unnatural lives about the size of an adult human. These smaller young are often called shambling piles. The strongest among these piles consume their many siblings, growing much larger and becoming true shambling mounds.

***Will Work for Food.*** Shambling mounds aren't malicious, and some show a capacity for learning. Daring (or foolish) adventurers might find that feeding a shambling mound a steady diet of evildoers turns them into a loyal companion.

You can make this attack a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
>

## Stirges

A tiny winged insectoid with a long proboscis, the stirge feasts not on blood, but on their prey's very soul. While feeding, a stirge poisons its target, eventually lulling them into a dazed stupor until the insectoid can devour their fill.

***Ill Omens.*** Experienced adventurers know that striges are drawn to areas of foul magic like those found in the lair of a vampire, lich, or evil mage. These fell beings encourage the striges to stay, feeding them prisoners or incompetent underlings.

***Stirge Brood.*** A single stirge is a minor annoyance—but it's rare to find just one. Removing a single soul-sucking stirge from one's body is unpleasant enough, but the true terror lies in wondering how many more remain in the shadows. Stirge nests typically contain several eager young broodlings, and while they lack the potent poison of their parents, broodlings attack in greater numbers.

***Stirge Companions.*** Should an adventurer adopt a stirge and provide plenty of villains to feast on, they'll likely find the little insectoid makes quite a loyal companion.

> ##### Content Warning: Soul Trauma
>
>You or your players may find it upsetting to describe a stirge sipping at their victim's soul. If so, you can adjust the description for everyone's enjoyment, making the stirge a creature who pumps venom into their victims instead.

## Time Raiders

The kuran'zoi ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Kuranzoi.html](coor-AN-zoy)), also called time raiders, are humanoids who make the Astral Sea their home. Many kuran'zoi make their living as guides for travelers from other planes, while others survive on the Sea of Stars through piracy of interplanar vessels.

Veterans of the Psychic Wars. Thousands of years ago, the synlirii—a powerful species of evil psionic aberrations—created kuran'zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented and enhanced these warriors' psionic abilities, the kuran'zoi saw the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Astral Sea, becoming nomads of the timescape.

***Hardened-Vision Hexapods.*** Kuran'zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the Astral Sea, the escaping kuran'zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar.

Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran'zoi is like a squad unto themself.

***Psi-Tech.*** Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran'zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.

***Genre Raiders.*** The moniker "time raider" is imprecise. When kuran'zoi raid a world of the timescape—like Orden—that relies on sorcery instead of kuran'zoi technology, it seems to those people as though the time raiders have been to the future and returned with marvelous weapons from worlds where light hits as hard as steel.

***Leave a Few Alive.*** Time raider pirates plunder traveling vessels, allowing just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home as a warning. Kuran'zoi pirate captains often remind their crews, "Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they'll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear."

Creatures Outside Time. While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don't age. As a result, many living kuran'zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of war into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war; time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.

> ##### But I Want a Blaster!
>
>Only time raiders can use the psionic weapons they wield in combat. On the other hand, it can be really fun for a player to have their character brandish a blaster, serrated saber, or golden scythe. At your discretion, these martial weapons use the following rules when wielded by a player character.
>
>***Blaster.*** The blaster is a ranged weapon that deals 1d6 radiant damage on a hit. Its normal range is 30 feet, and its long range is 90 feet.
>
>***Golden Scythe.*** This heavy, two-handed melee weapon deals 2d6 slashing damage on a hit. When you hit with this weapon, you can deal an extra 3d8 necrotic damage. Once you deal this extra necrotic damage, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
>
>***Serrated Saber.*** This melee weapon deals 1d8 slashing damage on a hit. As a bonus action, you can charge the serrated saber with psychic energy. The next creature you hit with the weapon before the end of this turn has disadvantage on the next attack roll they make before the start of your next turn.

**Time Raider Archon**

*Like all mindships, kuran'zoi raiding vessels are powered by thought. Over generations, this selection pressure increased the kuran'zoi's average intelligence far beyond what their progenitors intended.*— Remainer
> ##### Time Raider Encounters
>
>Time raiders are built to quickly get into a location, accomplish a task, and get out. Archons leave their foes dazed, making it difficult for enemies to chase the time raiders. Armingers knock foes prone and make their targets suffer disadvantage on attack rolls, so allies provoking opportunity attacks have a lower risk of taking damage as they move around the battlefield. The nemesis can move through walls and teleport around the battlefield, while the vertex excels at moving entire groups of allies with Invigorated March and Split Space.
>
>Because time raiders are so mobile, they make perfect candidates for encounters that are about more than a fight to the last warrior. Time raiders are excellent adversaries in encounters involving chases, robberies, and kidnappings.

## Titans

A titan slumbers beneath each of the eight regions of Orden, rousing from their sleep every few millennia—so infrequently, most people view the titans as mere legends. References to these beings of immense form and power appear on the walls of ancient temples and in histories of ancient catastrophes.

The few people who know the titans exist worship them as protectors and defenders against the end of the world. Though the titans of Orden rank among the most powerful creatures in the timescape, no texts even hint at where they came from, or who created them—if they were created. This section describes two titans: Goxomoc ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Goxomoc.html](GAUZ-ahmock)), titan of Ix, and the Kraken, titan of Higara. Some others, like the Phoenix, titan of Phaedros, are known, while the nature of several remains a mystery.

***Defenders of All the World.*** Legends and sages agree that the titans awaken only when their homeland, their people, or the entire world is threatened—but it's unclear what these godlike creatures view as a threat. They certainly don't seem interested in local politics, tyrants, plagues, or natural disasters. In truth, they await an existential threat powerful enough to destroy the world.

***Minds Forever Voyaging.*** The titans' powers combine psionics and elemental magics. Sages believe each titan is associated with a different element: air, earth, fire, water, and beyond.

Though the titans sleep, their dreams affect reality. For millennia, sailors around Higara have reported giant tentacled sea monsters they called krakens; these are obviously not *the* Kraken, but aspects manifested from that titan's dreams.

***Complex Communication.*** Direct communication with most titans is difficult, as mortals rarely register on their awareness. A powerful talent or beastheart might be able to forge a mental link with a titan, but they'd receive only impressions, images, feelings, and abstract ideas.

***Arise, Great Titan! Awake!*** Long-lost rituals could rouse a slumbering titan—though such a supplicant runs a very high risk of failure and death. The people of Ix speak of a time long ago when their priests woke Goxomoc to repulse a synlirii invasion, and they're confident they could rouse their titan again in time of need.

Sages believe that waking a titan for no reason would provoke them into a ruinous march, destroying entire swaths of Orden and wiping out thousands of mortal souls. Evil cultists seeking the destruction of the world agree, and thus they search tirelessly for the ritual to rouse a titan.

### Goxomoc

Goxomoc the Terror Lord slumbers under the great volcano called Ynixquichcauitl ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Ynixquichcahuitl.html](een-eeks-keesh-KAH-hooeetuhl)) which can be translated to "The End of All Things." The Oaxuatl people of Ix believe this volcano's inevitable eruption will signal the end of this world, and they look to it to determine the slumbering titan's mood.

The Oaxuatl respect and revere their protector in his aspects as a being of the earth and of storms. In both ancient and modern Ixian temples, iconography features Goxomoc in many stylized forms. The Oaxuatl do not pray to him, invoke his name, or even believe he is aware of them. But they share an unshakable belief that, should the land be threatened, the Terror Lord shall rouse and defend the land.

***Father of Terror.*** The Oaxuatl people believe Goxomoc created the tetzahuitl, the great terror lizards that dominate their island chain. They consider these "children of Goxomoc" to be sacred avatars of the titan.

***The Lightning Lord.*** Goxomoc relies on powerful and reality-bending psionics to defeat his enemies, but should his corporeal form fail, enemies find themselves face-to-face with Goxomoc's essence, Xogomoc—a giant terror lizard made of living lightning.

### The Kraken

Under the placid rolling waves of the ocean east of Higara, the Kraken—Titan of the Mindstorm—has slumbered restlessly beneath the seafloor for millennia. Many lesser krakens are born of the titan's furtive dreams and disturbed thoughts, rising to prowl the seas as they seek some bane or boon. But scholars are unsure what these Children of the Kraken seek, or what will happen if they complete their quest.

Just as Goxomoc symbolizes the earth and the great volcano that dominates Ix, the Kraken symbolizes the great ocean that provides food and industry for Higara. The ocean provides, and the ocean destroys.

The Kraken resembles a great, tentacled sea dragon, but they are not related to true dragons. Like the other titans, the Kraken's powerful psionics grant them awesome abilities. Their physical form is a unique amalgam of flesh, bone, and solid psionic energy.

***Little-Known Guardian.*** The people of Higara are largely unaware of the existence of their titan. They view the Emperor Naga, who slumbers in the cave beneath the Palace of the Empress, as the defender of their nation and region. It's unknown if any relationship exists between their Father of Serpents and the Titan of the Mindstorm.

Though land-dwellers care little for the Kraken, many fisherfolk make a living on the seas around Higara, following a way of life that has remained largely unchanged for thousands of years. These sailors know the Kraken and his children, and they paint stylized icons of a great sea serpent on their sails and carve kraken imagery into their ships.

## Treants

Trees awakened to consciousness by archdruids, treants care for the forest, nature, and the world as stewards and wardens. A face forms on their upper trunk, and their lower trunk divides into two legs. Vines twirl around the treant's flexible branches, which act as powerful arms that end in claws of sharpened wood.

***Chosen Ones.*** Archdruids can imbue a special sapling with transformative magic, bringing a treant sapling to life. This ritual is no ordinary plant awakening, and the saplings are carefully chosen for their appreciation of the natural beauty of the world and their desire to nurture it. Occasionally, an awakened sapling survives for thousands of years—often by retreating into the depths of an ancient forest—and grows to become a true treant. Most treants hold fast to their passion for nature and swear to defend the forest that allowed them to grow old and strong.

***Ripple Awakenings.*** Though the first treants were created by archdruids, an ancient treant can themself create new treants by bonding with a tree for a decade, then awakening the plant. The more ancient and undisturbed a forest, the more likely it holds a grove of treants ready to defend the land.

***Nature's Guardians.*** Treants are profoundly attuned to nature and their home forest. Many treant groves guard special areas, such as a druid's grove or a source of primal magic. These staunch protectors don't hesitate to confront questionable travelers, and they're likely to attack those who act recklessly toward the forest. Violence is rarely a treant's first course of action, but they have no interest in negotiating with anyone they deem untrustworthy. A provoked treant offers a single stern warning, which only the most foolish intruders ignore. When enemies inevitably flee, the treant rarely gives chase outside the bounds of their woods, satisfied they have defended their charge.

***One with the Forest.*** The magic within treants touches the webs of magic connecting their forest, allowing them to call forth vines and heal allies. Their roots sense the vibrations of nearby creatures. Treants can speak with both plants and animals, many of whom who act as their scouts.

***Treant Arrows.*** When another creatures risks their life for the forest standing side by side with a treant, the plant rewards the bravery by giving them one or more treant arrows.

## Trolls

The embodiment of carnivorous hunger, trolls rampage through the wild, leaving destruction in their wake. Tall and gangly, their mottled green skin is covered by a mane of matted hair that runs around their neck and down their back. In many ways, they resemble massive humanoids, but their exaggerated features belie this comparison; their lower jaw hangs unhinged and distended, and their long arms end in claws which drag along the ground as they walk.

***Hypermetabolism.*** A troll's constant hunger and aggression begets a life of violence. Like a grotesque miracle, they quickly assimilate consumed flesh into themselves to regenerate their body. Some scholars think this extreme metabolic process is the source of their hunger, but none know for certain which came first.

***Phases of Destruction.*** Fortunately for the ecosystems they inhabit, trolls can't be active all the time. Their natural behavior is to hunt relentlessly for a few days, then return to their dens to rest for as much as a week. Patient troll hunters can wait for this hibernation and catch the trolls by surprise—though the cost of waiting can be high, thanks to the damage the trolls might do in the meantime.

***Strange Mutations.*** Though a troll's preferred prey are humanoids and beasts, stories circulate of them feeding on undead, aberrations, and even celestials, assimilating their flesh to magnificent and horrifying effect.

***Limbjumbles.*** When a suitably large piece of mutated troll is torn off in battle, it does its very best to keep on living. Mutation and deep-seated survival instinct go into overdrive, sprouting unthinkable assortments of malformed arms and legs. Though these limbjumbles are ultimately short-lived, they can often be found tumbling awkwardly behind living trolls.

> ##### Mutated Trolls
>
>At the GM's discretion, a troll can mutate after consuming the flesh of an alien, powerful, or supernaturally created creature, gaining some of their prey's damage immunities and resistances, traits, or actions. For instance, a troll who devours a blue dragon might gain the creature's immunity to lightning damage and Lightning Breath action. Be aware this can significantly increase the difficulty trolls present in combat—especially if their mutations deal more damage than normal or grant immunity to acid or fire damage.

## Undead

Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something other than a mortal. No matter the reason for their creation, all undead were once living creatures who walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.

***Stuff of Nightmares.*** Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people's fear of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.

Given all the murder and anguish that has occurred at the rotting hands of the undead, their wicked reputation is well earned. But there are some honorable and kind mages who practice necromancy. They see the often-taboo school of magic as a tool that helps preserve resources and could be the key to unlocking eternal life.

***Dark Places.*** For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While it is rarely harmful to them, the sun's golden rays make them uncomfortable and seems to shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for the fearful eyes of mortals to spot an undead. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can better stalk their victims.

***Encountered Together.*** Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and wights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. Because undead don't need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe and many share an affinity for lightless places, they often gather together.

> ##### Undead in One Section
>
>This book presents a lot of the Undead creatures together in one section because most GMs tend to use ghouls, skeletons, vampires, zombies, and the like together in the same encounters. By keeping these Undead together, it makes for less page flipping or PDF scrolling for the GM when running an encounter.

### Incorporeal Undead

*These aren't your regular ghosts. They cling to this world, determined to take as many of the living with them as possible before they're destroyed.*— Racaar, Mystic Theurge of the Restless OrderShadows. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be formed by a person's vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer's dark art. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, spectral undead are malice incarnate.

***What They Can't Have.*** All spectral undead yearn for something only the living can provide. Specters and their lesser kindred, shades, vaguely remember their lives—and they're murderously envious of those who haven't lost theirs. Shadows want to drain living things of physical warmth and vitality (and the less tainted by evil their quarry is, the better). Meanwhile, wraiths greedily devour the living to taste their life essence.

***Drawn to the Living.*** Spectral undead who naturally formed from the souls of malicious, hate-filled humanoids usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being serve their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to slaughter living creatures they encounter. Some even leave the places they haunt to stalk their quarry over miles of wilderness.

#### Kiona the Dread Lord

Once a humble historian and archaeologist, Kiona Duemois stumbled across the *Codex Mortis*, a powerful tome of necromancy, in her travels. It changed her life forever—and ended it.

She spent months poring over her discovery, attempting to decipher the book's archaic passages. At first, she only meant to study the tome and record notes on her findings . . . but the codex called to her. Enthralled, Kiona convinced herself that she should just perform one of the book's smaller incantations for posterity. That one spell destroyed her earthly form and turned her ragged soul into a twisted, shadowy abomination of dark power.

The *Codex Mortis* mysteriously disappeared shortly after Kiona's death. In her new form, she set out to amass more power. The once genial archaeologist thirsts for the life of the living and yearns to hold the *Codex Mortis* once more. To those ends, she has built an army of spectral undead who carry out her every desire.

You can find out more about the *Codex Mortis* in *Strongholds & Followers*.

>Though most incorporeal undead were once Humanoid, you can easily make spectral undead from any other creature type. First, choose the stat block you want to use for the undead: shade, shadow, specter, or wraith. Then adjust the stat block's size and Intelligence score to match the original creature's statistics. That's all you need to do to make an incorporeal undead version of a creature.

### Lesser Corporeal Undead

At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, wights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Most lack a soul, and many can't think beyond the orders of their creators (unlike more powerful corporeal undead, such as liches and vampires). Those who aren't controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.

***Halted Processes.*** The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. These spells also halt decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration when magic touched them. Some experienced necromancers can even reverse a corpse's decay, making an undead appear living at a glance.

***Eternal Service.*** Most corporeal undead are created and controlled by a mage. Some guard libraries, laboratories, or treasures, while others perform menial labor. But the truly fearful undead are the soldiers in rotted armies, ready to conquer for their creator. These warriors never tire or complain. They have no need for food or drink. They exist only to lay waste.

When their mortal creators die, the undead unceasingly carry out their last orders. Some guard ruined towers for eternity while others search forests for long-escaped quarry. Should these final orders ever be fulfilled, most undead without a commander resort to killing any mortals they come across.

***Deriding Awareness.*** Some corporeal undead, such as ghouls and wights, come to being with awareness and full autonomy, even if the undead is at the command of another. However, these undead typically retain no memory or personality from their mortal life, and they act on desires instilled in them from their creator.

***Unique Risings.*** While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, there are tales of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astrological occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy. Some sages theorize that any place tainted with abundant evil could gradually animate a corpse with foul magic.

#### Crawling Claw

Crawling claws are severed hands animated by fell spells. The magic that granted them unlife also turns their fingernails into filth-covered blades. These tiny creatures are wickedly mischievous and make rude gestures at their opponents before attacking.

#### Ghoul

Though they don't require food to exist, ghouls endlessly hunger for mortal flesh. When a ghoul comes into being, their limbs and tongue grow longer, each ending in jagged claws and barbs. Negative energy courses through these weapons, allowing the ghoul to slow their prey and tear flesh from bones.

#### Skeleton

Without flesh to weigh them down, skeletons are among the most agile undead. This unnatural talent makes them prized archers in most necromancers' armies—doubly so because skeletons can use their remains as ammunition infused with necrotic energy, then regrow these expended bones the next day.

#### Wight

The most competent of the lesser corporeal undead, the sallow-skinned, red-eyed wights often protect necromancers in battle and issue orders to other undead. When given a general order (such as "destroy the farmlands"), they can make and execute a plan to achieve it. On top of their cunning, a wight's mere touch can drain a mortal's vitality.

#### Zombie

The most numerous of the corporeal undead, zombies are slow, mindless corpses who are tough to kill. They require very little magic to create, so even budding necromancers usually have a few zombie bodyguards, and zombies often fill the ranks of undead armies. Powerful necromancers wield enough magic to control much bigger corpses, reanimating giants into enormous war engines.

### Liches

A lich begins life as a mortal, often a wizard or sorcerer, fueled by a burning, unquenchable hunger for knowledge at any cost. Knowledge beyond life and death, beyond this world, beyond gods and fiends. Possesed by the unshakable belief that ultimate knowledge brings ultimate power. The necessary rites are forbidden in many cultures, for they require a bloody, evil act: the sacrifice of someone dear to the would-be lich.

***Forging Soulstones.*** The ritual to create a lich requires a sphere constructed of something personal to the subject, such as steel from an heirloom suit of armor or a tangle of branches from the tree that shaded their wedding. To complete the rite, the subject must rip out their own heart and the heart of a living loved one, placing both inside the sphere. The hearts conjoin and transmute into a ruby that welds to the sphere, creating the new lich's soulstone.

As long as their soulstone remains intact, a lich can never truly die. Most soulstones are small and easy to conceal, though a lich can construct the stone's outer sphere to be any size that suits their purpose.

***Terrifying Presence.*** A lich's true appearance is ghastly. The damage to their chest never heals, and over the centuries, their body slowly decays into a skeleton. Some liches hide their appearance with an illusion that makes them even more attractive and vivacious than they were in life. Others embrace their terrifying look, proudly displaying their dark triumph to every creature they encounter.

***Immortality Is Not Enough.*** Though all liches desire eternal life, it fails to satisfy most. These powerful former adventurers seek more of everything they've always craved—more glory, more power, more wealth. Most set about amassing all three, building armies of followers to seize whatever the lich desires from any who resist their charm.

***Lich Lairs.*** Liches are strongest when surrounded by devoted followers. Their lairs can be found inside strongholds, castles, government halls, or any place of power.

***Threats Demolished.*** Liches know the power of do-gooding adventurers who could threaten their pursuits and soulstone, and they seek to remain keenly aware of such threats. Adventurers with a treasure trove of powerful items or the potential strength to resist a lich are hunted mercilessly.

> ##### Soulstone Rejuvenation
>
>Most characters don't go up against a lich unprepared. By the time they face the villain in a final confrontation, characters (and their players) should understand how the lich's soulstone and Rejuvenation trait work. Since the soulstone can easily bring a lich back to life once the lich's soul is inside, the party's best shot at defeating them once and for all is to destroy the stone first, then kick some lich butt.
>

#### High Mage Vairae

Vairae ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Vairae.html](veh-RYE)) came from a long line of elf mages in Gael Wode. They excelled at school and easily made friends—which meant no one challenged them when they bullied the weaker children.

As an adult, Vairae joined the Gael garrison as a battle mage to round out their skills. Again they performed admirably and were showered with admirers and promotions. But after discovering a cryptic tome on the corpse of an enemy wizard, Vairae set their sights even higher—for the tome contained a ritual to keep their vigor and power forever. After many late nights spent deciphering the text, Vairae succumbed to the irresistible pull to complete this ritual . . . and sacrificed their best friend in the process.

Their heart now sealed in a sphere of everlasting ice, Vairae returned to Gael Wode in disguise and ambitiously rose to the rank of High Mage. Today, the centuries-old Vairae is as spry and handsome as ever, with loyal followers at their command. But the world outside the wode is large and doesn't belong to Vairae—yet.

> ##### Content Warning: Body Horror
>
>High Mage Vairae's Machinations of Bone action is gruesome and visceral. Not everyone enjoys that kind of body horror. If anyone at your table is uncomfortable with bone extraction, feel free to describe this action as spectral blades pressing in around Vairae's foes.

### Mournlings

> ##### Content Warning: Body Horror
>
>Flesh mournlings are conglomerations of many different creatures sewn together. If you or your players don't want such descriptions in your game, these mournlings could instead be made from plants or other natural material.
>

Powered by sorrow and rage, these animated conglomerations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss.

***Druidic Origins.*** Ages ago, a sect of druids came together to solve the endless exploitation and destruction of the natural world caused by humanoid expansion. How could the druids ever hope to combat such reckless waste—the logging of entire forests, the animals hunted to extinction, the mass destruction of war? Desperate, the druids invoked forbidden rites, forming bodies from the detritus of humanoid disasters and infusing them with necrotic energy. Flesh, dirt, and the souls of creatures lost to destruction combined with the druid's sorrow to become the first mournlings.

***Grieving Guardians.*** Though their creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, meadows, and other natural places they were built to protect. When expansion threatens a druid circle's corner of the world, the druids revive the ancient ritual and create new mournlings. Though the ritual is little-known outside of the most ancient druid sects, dedicated or lucky mages and clerics could uncover the rites and use them to create protectors for their towers and temples.

***Violence from Sorrow.*** Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then they burst into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.

Animal and Plant Protectors. Mournlings never intentionally harm an animal or plant creature, unless such a creature harms them first. During each mournling's creation, this compassion for nature is infused into their being—alongside the ever-present sorrow.

> ##### Making a Mournling
>
>If player characters wish to create a mournling to protect a wild habitat from destruction, they'll need to learn the secret creation rites—ones known only to the most secluded druid circles. The characters must journey to the home of one of these remote sects without harming the natural world. To characters who pass this first test, the druids offer a quest to prove the party's loyalty and love to nature. This quest usually involves battling those who seek to corrupt or harm the creatures of the wild.
>

#### Dirt Mournling

Dirt mournlings are guardians made of packed earth who leave a trail of silt or clay wherever they walk. A steady stream of tears constantly moistens the mournling's soil and makes them ooze mud.

The soil used to create a dirt mournling must come from a land razed by humanoid-made disaster. During each dirt mournling's creation ritual, their maker gives their soil a certain shape, typically that of an animal or humanoid. The mournling maintains this general form throughout their existence, though they can produce extra limbs during combat to grapple as many foes as they like.

#### Flesh Mournling

A flesh mournling is formed from different pieces of beasts, humanoids, and other creatures. The mournling's creators gather these body parts from creatures who were victims of humanoid expansion, carefully sewing them into what becomes the mournling's functional but grotesque form. No two flesh mournlings have exactly the same arrangement of body parts—some have multiple heads, while others have arms growing from long necks or feet protruding from mismatched shoulders.

**Dirt Mournling**

**Flesh Mournling**

### Mummies

Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead via a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature's soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death.

***Complex Ritual.*** Preventing a soul from finding eternal peace requires extraordinary magical effort. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. While different cultures practice various embalming methods, all result in a desiccated version of the body encased in a protective, flexible casing.

***Guardians, Prisoners, and Power.*** Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero may voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain may be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death. Still others with means become mummies for one simple reason: to live forever.

***Secrets of the Beyond.*** Existing in a realm between life and death grants mummies insight into the universe's great mysteries—and imbues them with unique power over living souls. When a mummy awakens to defend themself or their charge, they can use these powers to hamper foes with potent debilitating curses.

#### Ashyra, Keeper of the Crypt

Ashyra ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Ashyra.html](ah-SHEE-rah)) is the last survivor of an ancient people long passed from the world. Though traces of her civilization have disappeared from the surface, she still carries out her duty, guarding a subterranean necropolis where the remains of one hundred sorcerer-sovereigns rest in eternal slumber.

In her human life, Ashyra led a mystery cult dedicated to unlocking the secrets of immortality. She uncovered the ritual of mummification and performed it on herself just as her people were overthrown. In undeath, Ashyra works slowly and patiently, gathering the knowledge and supplies needed to return the sorcerer-sovereigns from the dead so her people may take back the world that was once theirs.

***City of the Dead.*** For now, Ashyra is cut off from the world above by powerful seals placed on the expansive necropolis she is bound to guard. She knows it is only a matter of time before she exhausts the knowledge within the magical tomes buried with her, so she eagerly waits for an opportunity to escape. Though Ashyra will do everything possible to protect her charges, she knows her people's glorious vision cannot come to pass unless she gains access to the world above.

Ashyra's lair is an underground tower full of books, scrolls, and arcane equipment. This tower guards the entrance to the chamber of the slumbering sorcerer-sovereigns.

**Mummy**

*In those days, the Chain was in service to Queen Nefrusheri. I dunno what she was queen of—probably Khemhara. I never bothered to ask. When your boss is an immortal mummy queen, the conversation tends to be pretty one-sided. "Yes ma'am" is about all I contribute.*— Dancer, Chronicler of the Chain of Acheron, Heroes 216–231**Mummy Rotwrap**

> ##### Khorsekef the Infinite
>
>**Khorsekef the Infinite**, First Pharaoh of the Khemharan Empire, ruled for over 3,000 years. Under his rule, the people of Khemhara thrived in the desert, and Khorsekef's power provided an oasis for an entire nation. What his people could not know, because the desert isolated them from the world, was that Khorsekef's rule denied them the right to change or grow. Though their god-king was human, he never died, and generation after generation turned to dust at his feet. Children were born, grew old, married, had children—but nothing ever changed. Names, likenesses, identities, and even discoveries were endlessly recycled.

>The Khem-hor thought this was the cycle of the world, but the truth was hidden from them until the great explorer Lady Agatamori, from Higara, exposed it. In truth, powerful artifacts kept the Khem-hor trapped within a perpetual cycle that fueled the pharaoh's immortality. During the ensuing struggle against Lady Agatamori and the Khemhor, Khorsekef was transformed into the timescape's most powerful mummy and trapped in the Abyssal Wasteland.

### Vampires

*They look like us. Sometimes they even act like us. But they are not like us.*— Lydia Lockwood, OccultistVampirism is a curse of blood. A curse that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life. They become beings of pure vitality that nonetheless hunger for life's essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims. Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their mortal forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves.

***Vampire Spawn.*** A vampire's power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and by their master's orders. Thanks to adventurers and zealous priests, few vampire spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.

***True Vampire.*** After about a hundred years of undeath, a spawn grows in strength and intelligence, becoming a true vampire. They learn to control their thirst and earn new gifts, allowing them to turn their victims into vampire spawn and to charm humanoids. These benefits let the vampire blend into humanoid society, often by masquerading as a long-lost relative of their old family or taking up their former profession. Meanwhile, they carefully choose prey and build a protective army of spawn and thralls.

***Vampire Lord.*** Most vampire lords have spent more than three hundred years in undeath. Some are created through powerful magic. Most have been so corrupted by their curse that they have no moral code and stop at nothing to get what they want. After centuries of amassing resources, vampire lords have the power to achieve nearly any goal. Some build empires. Others seek godhood. A few lie dormant, buried in sarcophagi while the ages flow past, waiting to awaken in new worlds ripe for the plucking.

***Strengths and Weaknesses.*** Though most vampires shun sunlight, some know a secret ritual to counteract this weakness. Vampires don't require food, water, or air, but their bodies become desiccated husks if they don't regularly drink the blood of living beings. Each vampire has a special resting place, typically a coffin or similar vessel, where they can regenerate after an arduous battle. While thus recuperating, they can't move.

***Vampire Thralls.*** True vampires and vampire lords can cast *geas*, which charms other creatures to do the vampire's bidding. Vampires use this spell to charm creatures in positions of authority. Most have at least one or two thralls working in local governments, which allows the vampire to prey on the populace without any interference from law enforcement or military.

Though magic makes reliable thralls, vampires also rely on promises and coercion to maintain a reliable feeding ground and enact sinister plots. Some humanoids are so desperate for power that they will kill for a vampire in exchange for a promise of being turned into one of the undead someday. Vampires also rely on their servants and supernatural abilities to uncover the crimes and misconduct of mortals in power. Those secrets are used to blackmail people into doing a vampire's bidding.

Whenever a servant disobeys a vampire, swift retribution comes in the form of teeth to the neck. At least they can serve as a drink. There is always another who can take the thrall's place.

***Exsanguinating Weapons.*** Vampire lords can summon exsanguinating weapons made from the blood of their enemies. Only they can wield these weapons, and when a vampire is destroyed, their exsanguinating weapons disappear. The most infamous of these weapons is Sanguinus, the sword of Count Rhodar von Glauer.

***Blood-Starved Vampires.*** When a vampire goes without blood for a year or more, their body shrivels, becoming a living husk. The vampire's thirst for blood becomes their singular focus as their weakened form craves it. These blood-starved vampires often band together for survival, since a single blow can turn one to dust. A blood-starved vampire must drink the blood of scores of humanoids to be restored to an unweakened state.

#### Vampire Lairs

Vampire spawn hide anywhere they can avoid the sun, such as tombs, sewers, or cellars. True vampires build more lavish lairs—opulent manors, shadowed castles, and vast crypts spiraling beneath the earth. Vampire lords lair in blackened towers, hollowed moons, and private demiplanes where the light of day never reaches.

#### Count Rhodar von Glauer

*I do the devil's work.*— Motto of House von GlauerAfter falling to a vampiric curse in his early twenties, Count Rhodar—the last Lord of Glauer—ruled his tiny, heavily forested mountainous county in eastern Rhöl for three hundred years. There were worse overlords, the people said. After all, Rhodar took his pact with the people and the land seriously. He aggressively defended the villages in his demesne against constant incursions from rival counts and barons. He believed his power waxed and waned with the prosperity of the people and the vitality of the land.

Each new moon, when the Red Tax came due, the count would visit a young candidate, then emerge with renewed vitality. Across the land, folk feared their Dragon Count, but the witches of the wood wove a prophecy: "The land's darkest hour shall be the redemption of House von Glauer."

Eventually, the conquering force of Emperor Gaius VIII came for Rhodar—not because he was a vampire, but because the empire wanted his land and people. Count von Glauer was staked, and his body burned to ash. The emperor kept the Rod of Count Rhodar von Glauer as a trophy, and with this symbol of authority, he sealed his claim to the land.

Under new rule, Rhodar's people lament the absence of their lord, recalling the time before the coming of the empire as a golden age. But the witches' whispers can still be heard. For as long as the people of Glauer persist, they continue believing their Dragon Count will return in their darkest hour to deliver them from tyranny.

> ##### Atypical Vampire Diet
>
>Vampires thirst for the blood of the living, but not all feast upon innocent sapient creatures. Some live off the blood of animals, though most vampires, including the ones who practice drinking from animals, find the taste of beast blood disgusting. These vampires hold their proverbial noses and gulp the animal blood down, because to them the alternative is unconscionable.
>
>Other vampires indulge their bloodthirst by drinking from the wicked. These undead become vigilantes or adventurers, hunting the corrupt in search of a meal. Some are venerated by their communities as heroes while others keep their undead nature a secret, revealing it only when they drink from the neck of an adversary.

> ##### Excerpt from the Chronicle of the Chain of Acheron
>
>"In those days the Chain was in service to the Emperor Gaius VIII, third of the Five Crusading Emperors, and 27th Emperor of Caelia. Gaius continued the crusades started by his illustrious granduncle. Those were profitable days for the Chain, the Wheel, and the Gate. While the other Helltroopers waded into the deserts of Khoursir and Khemhara, we battled in the forests of Vaslor. We had it easy. I hate deserts.
>
>"Thinking his vampiric power would save him, Count Rhodar von Glauer waited until he was fulsome in his strength before trying to extend his dark realm into Caelian territory. But we know how to deal with vampires. The black and gold standard of the von Glauer family reads, "I do the devil's work." We can attest to that. We lost many souls to that long siege, but in the end, we staked him. An old woman howled at us saying, "He is the land!" but we hear that stuff all the time. We sacked his castle, burned his forest and orchards, and delivered his staff to the emperor. That was harder than it sounds. Finger had to drop it in one of his bottomless sacks to stop the mists from coming. What the emperor will do with it, I don't know. I fear that staff may hold more than the power to make the mist."

## Valok

Steel dwarves, the greatest artisans of the Mundane World, built valok from rare ores buried deep in the earth. Though these dwarves have disappeared, their incredible constructs remain. No other blacksmith, inventor, or mage has created anything like these magnificent machines.

***Rare Metal Body.*** Steel dwarves unlocked the secrets of smithing valiar—the truemetal—prized not only for its strength and flexibility, but for its entrancing silverywhite beauty. They could turn valiar into anything, from breathtaking weapons and exquisite buildings to hypnotic gossamer fabrics that are nearly transparent and virtually indestructible. The secrets of working with the truemetal disappeared with the dwarves, but not before they built the nigh-invulnerable bodies of the valok.

***Prismacore Power.*** The steel dwarves also mined iridoss, commonly known as prismacore. This rare gemstone was infused with the power of other worlds. Unlike other constructs who are powered by spells or prayer, each valok's prismacore heart allows them to operate without magic. Since prismacore never loses power, valok can work ceaselessly, without rest or respite.

***Mechanized Evolution.*** The first valok were great machines made to dig, smelt, and build. Legends say these giant walkers could build entire cities in a matter of days and could even construct other valok. As the steel dwarves learned the deep secrets of prismacore, they made machines that could speak and think more freely.

While two classes of valok—servok and multivok—have been discovered, ancient steel dwarf carvings hint that a highly advanced third class was created just before the makers disappeared.

***Ancient and Deep.*** Ruined valok litter the deepest ruins of the steel dwarves, and without the secrets of the steel dwarves, their valiar and iridoss are useless to modern smiths. But some valok still labor in the depths, carrying out their final orders and ready to end any who interfere.

### Servok

Servoks, the labor and siege class of valok, are huge, slow, and built for a specific purpose—though all are designed to defend themselves when threatened. No humaniform servoks have been discovered; their forms depend on their purpose, but they're never smaller than a wagon. Despite each servok's utilitarian construction and the ages of grime accumulated atop their iridoss, each servok is impressive to behold.

The dead language of the steel dwarves is lost to time and beyond the reach of most magic, but scholars believe that someone who spoke this ancient tongue could command a servok. Even then, servoks can't act outside their design parameters—a servok designed to mine ore can't be commanded to make a vase.

***Servok Builder.*** Steel dwarves used one class of servoks, called builders, to construct buildings, roads, and walls. Their valiar arms can lift and fling enormous stones, and a great mixing cannister on their back holds concrete that can be spewed forth from an opening at the front of the construct. The steel dwarves equipped each builder with a valiar wrecking ball to demolish any old construction impeding the servok's progress.

Some active builders still work the caverns where they were left, clearing the ground in preparation for some grand project known only to their progenitors.

***Servok Miner.*** Servok miners dug the legendary tunnels of the steel dwarves. These track-driven constructs are equipped with a mechanical drill and pneumatic pick to break through stone with ease. A conveyor belt at the front of the valok allows them to load ore for transport or unload debris in a violent spray.

A few miners still dig tunnels deep into the earth, searching for ore and ready to destroy anything in the way of their search.

***Servok War Engine.*** The quaking of earth and boom of an arcane cannon precedes the arrival of a servok war engine. Built to roll through enemy ranks with their bladed rake, the war engine can also eliminate targets from afar with their massive gun that shoots both magic blasts and burning oil.

There are still war engines that went to battle and haven't returned. They consider every creature they meet who isn't a steel dwarf to be an enemy

### Multivok

Smaller than servoks, multivoks can speak and carry out commands, though their capacity for complexity is limited. While multivoks are humaniform, their masterfully crafted bodies lack the expression and fine articulation of humanoids. They were built to run and maintain ships and ore harvesters, survey dangerous or distant locations, guard nobles, and oversee servoks—tasks which many multivoks tirelessly attempt to continue today.

***Multivok Bodyguard.*** With arms ending in axe blades and repeating crossbows mounted on their shoulders, a multivok bodyguard cuts an impressive figure. They can activate a magnetic power to yank armored targets toward them and away from their charges.

Multivok bodyguards that are still active are typically guarding the bones or possessions of their long-dead charge with unfaltering loyalty.

***Multivok Chief.*** One of the most advanced multivoks, a chief directs and coordinates other valok to get work done. They were built to oversee projects in the absence of steel dwarf supervisors. Each chief wields a targeting beam that allows them to direct other valok toward enemies and objects that require destruction.

Active chiefs still roam the halls of the steel dwarves, organizing their fellow constructs to protect treasures, construct buildings, destroy invaders, and dig tunnels.

## Voiceless Talkers

Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (singular: synliroi) are known as the "voiceless talkers" to the denizens of the World Below—and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them. Descended from boneless aquatic cephalopods, they are alien in thought and motivation to the humanoid species they loathe. Synlirii consider the "barking ones" (their label for creatures who squeeze air through meat flaps to communicate) to be an abomination that must be corrected.

***Uneasy Alliances.*** Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.

***Olothec Hatred.*** The synlirii's visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) olothec. Ancient myths say olothec created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications that their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.

***Psionic Spies.*** Despite their mental powers, voiceless talkers consider information their greatest weapon. They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their forms, and pass undetected among other cultures.

***Psi-Tech.*** Synlirii breed mollusks that secrete plastic-like substances, using them to fashion weapons and similar technology powered by psionic crystals. The voiceless talkers' handheld psi-pistols and portable psi-rifles can be used only by their alien minds.

***Creature Engineers.*** Synlirii are obsessed with manipulating the natural development of other organisms. They create hulking brains, mindkillers, and other servants using a psionic technique they call the Interlace. Many synlirii experiments don't live long and aren't intended to. But the World Below is littered with unnatural creatures who escaped the voiceless talkers' body banks—most of them singular life forms that can't reproduce and may never die.

***Graywarpers.*** Graywarpers are voiceless talkers who were drained of most of their psionic abilities—and free will—as punishment for insolence or incompetence. They are viewed solely as expendable tools who enhance the power of other voiceless talkers.

> ##### Absolute Evil
>
>Voiceless talkers are evil sapient beings who engage in reprehensible and irredeemable acts of eugenics. While you can create exceptional synlirii who fight against such philosophies and practices, the voiceless talkers who participate in genetic experiments are unquestionably evil.
>

### Hulking Brain

The voiceless talkers have engineered pearlescent-skinned, humanoid-shaped aberrations with four massive arms and—in place of a head—a large pulsing brain. Called thylinça by voiceless talkers and hulking brains by everyone else, these creatures serve as bodyguards and psionic batteries for their synlirii creators.

### Mindkiller

Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers' pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid's body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim's central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim's knowledge and memories and can puppet the body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller's synlirii overlords.

Mindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller that can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can't inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes' mental defenses against psionics.

### Lord Syuul

Chief Design Architect of his nation's body banks, the synliroi Lord Syuul ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Syull.html](see-YOU-ull)) seeks more material for his experiments. His spies, informants, and allies are always on the lookout for subjects with unique hereditary traits the Interlace might extract.

Lord Syuul, who belongs to an ancient and respected noble house, never leaves his estate without a retinue of guards and minions. They obey his orders fanatically—as Syuul has ensured they're biologically incapable of refusing to do so.

Syuul's recent experiments have focused on isolating the trait that expresses sorcerous ability in humanoids. Thus far, these attempts have been unsuccessful. Not to be deterred, Lord Syuul has placed his assistant in charge of the day-to-day operations of the body banks, while Syuul himself ventures forth to observe the surface world and plunder its diversity.

**Voiceless Talker**

> ##### Psi-Tech
>
>While most psi-tech weapons can be used only by voiceless talkers, a character using the talent class (from the MCDM supplement [https://mcdm.gg/talent](The Talent and Psionics)) can use these weapons by gaining 1 strain each time they make an attack with one. A creature using a psi-tech ranged weapon uses Intelligence instead of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls.

## Wyverns

Dragons can be poor hosts, but at least they can be reasoned with. Wyverns, on the other hand, have the ferocity of dragons without their intelligence or ego. Their aggression is driven by hunting and territorial instinct. Many adventurers meet their end in the wyvern's maw—some because the wyvern saw them as competitors, and others because the wyvern was simply hungry.

Wyvern scales match the colors of the mud, rock, and rust that dominate the mountains and badlands where they prefer to reside. Unlike true dragons, wyverns don't have front legs—instead, they walk like bats, propelled by their rear legs and balancing on the joints of their wings.

***Mountain Hunters.*** While on the hunt, wyverns perch on stone outcroppings and natural spires overlooking their territory. They first attack with their stinger, injecting prey with corrosive acid. If a wyvern's victim attempts to hide, the wyvern's hooked claws and fearsome teeth can tear open any crag or crevice in pursuit.

***Acidic Aggressors.*** Without front limbs to grasp their prey, wyverns prefer to keep their distance and strike with their long, stinger-tipped tails. A single sting is usually enough to kill common game outright, and even larger foes are left wracked by pain. Wyverns have no interest in a drawn-out struggle, and they relentlessly sting their foes at every opportunity.

***Protective Parents.*** A wyvern's infamous temper is easily provoked, particularly if their eggs or hatchlings are threatened. Many monster slayers for hire won't accept contracts to track and hunt wyverns during hatching season. Yet this season is when heroes are needed most, as mated pairs aggressively hunt anything or anyone to feed their young.

*I always feel better, seeing a wyvern. Makes me feel like the wilderness still has power, strength. Like the forest still has a chance.*— Lady Demelza, Courser**Wyvern**

# Chapter 2: Environments

Mummies lurk in tombs, but what other dangers wait in the crypt's darkness? Which monsters lurk in the enchanted forest that adventurers must cross to reach their destination? What new traits does a sewer-dwelling owlbear gain? This section presents eight typical adventure environments and a handful of creatures found within each. These environments aren't necessarily biomes, though some biomes are included here. Each environment is the kind of place the player characters might enter or pass through while seeking adventure, such as roads or swamps, or the underground world below the surface of the Mundane World.

## Environmental Features

Most of the environments in this book provide traits and lair actions you can give to creatures who live there. These traits and lair actions are designed to work with creatures of any challenge rating; as a result, they often don't use static numbers for things like damage dice and save DCs. Instead, this book sometimes calls for you to use the creature's proficiency bonus (abbreviated as PB).

For example, when a creature deals damage, they might use a number of dice equal to the creature's proficiency bonus. If a creature has a +3 proficiency bonus and their trait "deals PBd10 force damage," that's 3d10 force damage.

Similarly, when a feature requires a saving throw, the DC might add the creature's proficiency bonus. If a creature has a +3 proficiency bonus and their trait calls for a "DC 12 plus PB Dexterity saving throw," that's a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

## Cave

Some caves are simple holes in a mountainside, while others are cavernous recesses cutting through the bowels of the earth—but all are a source of fascination, fear, and adventure. As all savvy adventurers know, caves can contain treasures untold or a death most unceremonious. Beware the dark.

### Cave Traits

You can create a cave version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- Hear the Unseen
- Rockbreaker
- Tunnel-Adapted

### Cave Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in a cave by giving them the following lair actions:

Cave Lair Actions

### Fossil Cryptic

The cave-diving humans who first found fossil cryptics initially thought those beings were fossilized, reanimated skeletons of creatures predating recorded history. When the explorers' priest presented a holy symbol and attempted to turn the cryptics, he learned these fossilized bones aren't mindless undead—and seconds later, he wound up crushed to death by a pillar of stone.

***Primal Sentries.*** In truth, these living fossil amalgamations are inhabited by elemental spirits. Fossil cryptics are found in places of otherworldly beauty with a connection to an elemental plane of Quintessence—often in caves that have remained untouched for eons or whose tunnels are laced with veins of priceless metal in exquisite fractal patterns. The elemental spirits from that plane inhabit the fossils of creatures who once protected the site, carrying on their legacy. Archaeologists, miners, and others who disturb a cryptic's domain are ground into dust and subsumed into the cryptic's own form.

***Bones of the Earth.*** Though fossil cryptics vary wildly in their chosen shape and form, all contain a central cluster of fossils atop a churning column of rock and metal. With malleable limbs extending from their earthy core, cryptics move with unsettling quickness.

***Ancient Intelligence.*** Fossil cryptics often warn trespassers to leave their domains, speaking threats in Primordial before attacking. They weaponize columns of stone at range and can manipulate the ground around them, pushing and pulling friend and foe alike into the best positions for a battle.

### Koptourok

> ##### Content Warning: Suffocation
>
>The koptourok steals the breath of their victims. If you or any of your players find descriptions of suffocation upsetting, you may want to avoid using this creature or reflavor their abilities.
>

Derived from an archaic duergar dialect, koptourok ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Koptourok.html](cop-TOUR-ock)) roughly translates to "dead tourist." These lost dead were raised in a world with a sky then spent their last moments in a dark, breathless place. They rise as rasping paper-skinned husks, like a cross between an unwrapped mummy and accordion bellows that forever expand and contract. They hunger only for what they've lost—breath.

***Abhorrent Vacuums.*** Those rare adventurers who have met a koptourok and lived to tell the tale can identify signs of one nearby. The air becomes noticeably thinner in the presence of this undead, and what little there is moves toward the koptourok.

***Ghoulish Symbiosis.*** Flesh-eating undead often hunt in tandem with a koptourok, since the breath-stealer can take what is theirs and leave the body for scavengers. It's especially common to see ghouls alongside a koptourok.

### Lamasombra

The lamasombra ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Lamasombra.html](lah-mah-SAHM-brah))—an eight-legged, gray-scaled reptile the size of an adult human—is almost certainly the work of a flesh-bending mage or cult. This lizard-arachnid hybrid specializes in hunting cavedwelling denizens.

***Apex Cave Predator.*** The lamasombra's unnatural scales bend darkness in a way that interferes with other creatures' darkvision. In dim light, this gives creatures without darkvision an unusual advantage against the lamasombra, as those with darkvision can't see the predator except in bright light. The lamasombra's specialized bones and foot pads eliminate sound and vibrations even at blinding speeds, rendering their prey's tremorsense useless. The creature's diseased mouth infects prey with boiling wastes disease, which keeps a victim feverish and bleeding long after an attack. After weakening their prey, the lamasombra follows the blood trail, stalking from the shadows and waiting for the diseased creature to die.

***Gleeful Hunter.*** If a lamasombra has any weakness, it's that they enjoy playing with prey a little too much. Once they pick a target, they are unrelenting in their pursuit, but patient in picking their moment to strike. They often needle prey for days before finally delivering sweet release from torment.

### Yumgrub

The yumgrub looks like an oozing apple-sized dumpling with a hundred tiny legs. Like a dumpling, the insect contains a delicious secret: their sweet flesh temporarily enhances the speed and strength of whoever consumes it. However, eating the yumgrub has a cost. They unleash a deeply upsetting scream when consumed, and after their magic wears off, it leaves the eater weary.

***Subterranean Delicacy.*** The yumgrub is the larval stage of the unremarkable tunnel moth. Subterranean and cave-dwelling humanoids first discovered their magic properties and began trading the larvae among communities of dwarves, elves, and goblins. Due to the yumgrub's remarkable benefits, underground conquerors sometimes use them to fuel soldiers in battle.

## Enchanted Forest

*He who has no dreams, let him go to a beautiful forest to have many.*— Mehmet Murat IldanMagic permeates nature. From fulminating thunderstorms to nurturing berries, nature answers when adventurers seek its verdant potency. Where planar veils are thin, ancient spirits dwell, or ley lines emanate wild energy, enchanted forests await with mesmerizing creatures and mysteries.

### Enchanted Forest Traits

You can create an enchanted forest version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- Speak with Beasts and Plants
- Tree Stride
- Living Forest

### Enchanted Forest Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in an enchanted forest by giving them the following lair actions:

Enchanted Forest Lair Actions

### Bonestalker

Whispered legends tell of horrors who dwell in the deepest, darkest forests and torment villages on the outskirts. These so-called bonestalkers feed on the terror of their victims—and of entire villages—long before going in for the kill.

Bonestalkers are tall and unsettlingly thin. Their head is a monstrous skull with a jutting jaw, and their long arms are flightless black wings that end in clawed hands. Bonestalkers collect the skulls of their victims, carrying them inside their wings as they draw power from these trophies.

Fear Tactics. The bonestalker prefers to isolate their prey, using illusion spells to lure unwitting wanderers into the woods. These psychological tormenters enjoy a prolonged chase and a slow kill, drawing nourishment from their prey's fear. When a victim refuses to give in to terror, the enraged bonestalker attacks in a reckless fury.

> ##### Revealing a Bonestalker
>
>Bonestalkers are cryptids—their chilling legend, unsolved murders, and unconfirmed existence add to the terror they might inflict on adventurers. You can lead characters through an investigation of mysterious murders surrounding a forest village . . . then have the bonestalker pull out the victims' skulls during the fight, and let the characters connect the dots.
>

### Dancing Lady

Strange visions in the mist are to be expected in enchanted forests, but in the case of the dancing lady, these figures aren't illusions—they're real . . . sort of.

The dancing lady is an enormous plant with white humanoid-sized flowers resembling figures in dresses. Large red-and-green leaves surround these hanging blooms. The dancing lady lurks around fey populations or other forest denizens, flowers peacefully turning until a threat appears. Once the plant's allies are endangered, the dancing lady's oversized flowers spring into dizzying dances to addle and frighten foes.

### Empyrean Stag

As Celestial wardens of the forest, empyrean stags appear only to defend forest denizens from great threats or to warn mortals about forthcoming calamities. Their white fur is dappled with blue, and their eyes shine with the darkness of night.

***Unyielding Defenders.*** Adventurers often clash with forest denizens, from hungry owlbears to mischievous fey. This violence draws an empyrean stag's ire, often provoking a deadly attack from the stag and their forest allies. Repentant adventurers can make restitution by helping the stag defend the wood from an even greater threat.

***Divine Knowledge.*** Those who impress an empyrean stag—typically by protecting the forest—are allowed to ask the stag one question, which the Celestial answers truthfully to the best of their ability. Between their antlers, they can show shimmering visions of the present or glimpses of the future. The horns glow gold when the stag aids an ally, and white when they divine information.

### Rotbeast

Enchanted forests aren't always flowers and vines—sometimes they're fungi, blight, and the creatures who carry them. One such creature, the rotbeast, turns faerie paradises into festering decay simply by passing through.

This faceless, fungi-covered creature has twisting stag horns and the body of a bull. As they wander the woods, they spoil vegetation in their path and create a network of fungi and decay.

***Territorial Herds.*** Rotbeasts live in herds and prefer to keep to one part of the forest, provided they have plenty of space. Other creatures who invade their territory are given no quarter. The rotbeasts weaken foes with their gouging horns, infect them with rotting hooves, then add new corpses to their decaying domain.

***Fungal Allies.*** Fungus-based plant creatures often peacefully coexist with rotbeasts, as they thrive in decaying lands. Some fungi even herd rotbeasts into new areas to make the forest more to their liking.

**Bonestalker**

> ##### More Skulls!
>
>At your discretion, a bonestalker isn't limited to the skulls they start combat with. They can pick up skulls on the battlefield and use those as further fuel for their abilities.

**Empyrean Stag**

> ##### Good-Aligned Enemies
>
>It can be difficult to know when to deploy creatures who are typically good-aligned as enemies for the characters to fight. That's why there aren't many in this book. However, these creatures still have agendas that can bring them into conflict with the characters. For instance, the empyrean stag protects enchanted forests from violent invaders, and if the characters do battle with any creature native to the forest, it draws the stag's ire.

## Graveyard and Tomb

Adventurers who enter graveyards and ancient tombs often do so to keep the dead at rest, stop necromancy rituals, or consult the ghosts of wise sages and heroes of the past.

### Graveyard and Tomb Traits

You can create a graveyard or tomb version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- Armor of Decay
- Touch of Rot
- Undying Hunger

### Ashen Hoarder

Grave robbing is dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders—hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.

***Appendages and Spikes.*** The hoarder sports four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct's grim work. Articulated arms with attached tools and weapons aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies.

When the hoarder obtains a corpse, the construct impales it on one of the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with necrotic energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer's door.

***Bodies as Weapons.*** If enemies corner the hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as zombie allies or detonate the remains with explosive necrotic energy.

### Blood-Borne Ooze

Blood-borne oozes form when ambient necrotic energy seeps into the blood of a corpse. Hunger drives these creatures to slither from their rotting birthplace, seeking to feed on the bodily fluids of a living victim—from the inside.

Outside a host body, a blood-borne ooze resembles a gelatinous pool of blood mixed with other bodily ichor. The ooze's ability to permeate skin—living or dead—allows them to infect unsuspecting mourners, coroners, gravediggers, or other individuals who frequent cemeteries.

***Hidden Parasites.*** Whenever possible, a blood-borne ooze prefers to feed stealthily, inhabiting a host and draining their vitality over an extended period. Through careful feeding, an ooze can exist inside the same host for weeks before symptoms become apparent. Even then, the cause is commonly misdiagnosed until it's too late.

### Haunt

When a mass of souls meet a dark and bloody death, the unfortunate souls occasionally fuse into a furious collective called a haunt. Such tormented amalgamations of spirits are doomed to stalk the scene of their death until they're laid to rest.

These undead clouds of psychic energy are usually invisible, but when viewed with the *see invisibility* spell or similar magic, they appear as a churning silver-green fog of tangled limbs and screaming faces.

Souls drawn into a haunt lose all sense of individuality. Their pain, memories, and outrage meld into a confused mass that makes rational thought nearly impossible. Haunts can rarely tell friend from foe, and react violently to the presence of any being in their domain.

***Physically Bound.*** Unlike other ghosts, haunts are exclusively bound to the Mundane World, unable to leave the site where they formed. As such, a haunt can't retreat to the Ethereal Plane when endangered, but their rooted nature grants them greater control over physical objects in the environment than most incorporeal creatures achieve.

***Tortured Torturers.*** A haunt's dominant emotional state is abject rage, driving them to seek vengeance on all living beings. Haunts aren't content to merely slaughter their prey—they sadistically aim to trap and torment their victims.

### Lightthief

A lightthief is a fiend who comes to the Mundane World to feast on soul energy. They stalk graveyards and tombs, where they know vulnerable mourners come in the dark to pay their respects. These bat-winged creatures resemble flayed humanoid hands with a bloodshot eye leering from the palm—though their victims have little chance to notice them before darkness falls.

***Death in the Dark.*** Lightthieves often stalk victims in groups, using their supernatural powers to enter—and extinguish—light sources near their prey. The lightthieves consume each light's energy, then just before attacking, use this energy to power a hex that temporarily robs creatures of their darkvision.

The predator's strategy isn't without flaws. If another creature snuffs out a light source the fiend has entered, the lightthief is shunted out and momentarily helpless. Adventurers delving into burial sites would be wise to research such defenses.

***Desperate for Despair.*** While lightthieves prefer to target mourners, the graveyards and tombs they haunt are eventually forgotten. A lightthief in an ancient burial site is so ravenous for soul energy that they attack any living being they come across.

**Ashen Hoarder**

**Blood-Borne Ooze**

> ##### Blood-Borne Surprise
>
>A blood-borne ooze doesn't have to start consuming their host the moment the parasite enters the body. Instead, the ooze might enjoy the host's protection for a while, eating only when hungry. The characters could battle a foe only to have a blood-borne ooze or three suddenly emerge after damaging the enemy.

*Only human graveyards are haunted, have you ever thought about that? There's something about us, about death. It's not dying, there's something about being alive we haven't figured out. If we knew how to live, maybe we wouldn't be so angry when we're dead.*— Lady Demelza, Courser**Blood-Borne Ooze Companion**

For the duration, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
>

## Road

When people travel well-patrolled thoroughfares and live in sleepy hamlets, it's easy to believe that adventure is something that happens far away. But the wealth and assumed security of settled lands make them rich pickings for predators of all sorts—particularly those who can disguise their sinister natures or hide beneath the roads.

### Ankheg

Pebbles click as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon's peace, and an ankheg blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal: sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.

An ankheg is a chitinous, burrowing monstrosity larger than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.

***Pastoral Pest.*** Although ankhegs can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. Ankhegs hunt alone or in pairs, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make ankhegs virtually impossible to eradicate—unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain ankheg.

***Terror of the Thaw.*** Ankhegs are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, ankhegs hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace . . . but this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every ankheg awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.

### Bredbeddle

In their true forms, bredbeddles are headless giants who stand about fifteen feet tall. Forever searching for their missing heads, they are drawn to populous lands, where they decapitate passersby and magically adopt their victims' forms.

Although bredbeddles have no traditional sensory organs of their own, they are keenly aware of their surroundings. Some lurk along dark country lanes in their monstrous true forms. Others walk disguised among crowds, dropping their facades only long enough to waylay a stranger and lop off their head.

***Immortal Wanderers.*** Bredbeddles don't age, and even when slain, their bodies reform a few days later. Long ago, bredbeddles were giants who stood high among the nobility of giantkind. But when they declared themselves rulers of all giantkind, their kin thwarted the coup and beheaded the bredbeddles. Now these fallen nobles search the world for their missing heads, each wielding the axe that decapitated them. Many claim their heads are kept for safekeeping in some fire giant's cellar, believing they'll be returned after an indeterminate period of good behavior (which the bredbeddles have thus far not exhibited).

### Weeping Willow

When a dryad bonds with a tree, the connection grants the tree immortality and a measure of fey magic. The encroachments of civilization, however, threaten this sylvan idyll. Many dryads fall to a woodcutter's axe, while others become infatuated with a mortal and choose to leave their tree—and immortality—behind. A tree that mourns for their lost dryad becomes a weeping willow.

***Lake of Tears.*** A weeping willow bears drooping branches that sprinkle the ground with the tree's tears. If they stand in one spot long enough, a pond of saltwater eventually forms—and sometimes, those waters reflect the image of a dead dryad. Creatures who seek shelter in a weeping willow's bower find themselves overcome with a lethargic melancholy, and many wanderers starve to death rather than stir from this rest.

***Verdant Vengeance.*** Although not fundamentally evil, weeping willows resent mortals for taking their dryads away. The trees haunt the borders of settlements, luring their prey with song and sweet words or catching them in gnarled roots. Willows whisper words of vengeance to likeminded creatures, mustering allies against nearby humanoid settlers. They also rain enchanting tears to transform their greatest enemies into enthralled allies—or if that fails, into twisted trees.

**Ankheg**

*Oh do *not* leave the road! Especially if there's like a hundred yards between the road and the forest? That is 100% ankheg territory.*— Pinna, Hedge Witch, Gravesford**Bredbeddle**

**Weeping Willow**

## Ruined Keep

Whether a crumbling wizard's tower or the lonely outpost of a long-since-forgotten kingdom, the ruined keep can be found in any environment. These crumbling structures might be decrepit, but they are rarely abandoned.

### Ruined Keep Traits

You can create a ruined keep version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- Ruin Climber
- Ruin Delver
- Ruin Runner

### Ruined Keep Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in a ruined keep by giving them the following lair actions:

Ruined Keep Lair Actions

> ##### Express Descent Goes Deep
>
>Some players and GMs enjoy that the Express Descent lair action can drop characters into a new level of the keep, while others feel this makes tracking combat difficult and puts a lot of work on the GM. If you'd like to simplify where a creature who falls through the floor winds up, you can have them fall into a 10-foot-deep pit. A fallen creature takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall and lands prone, and they can climb out of the pit without making an ability check.
>

### Former Purpose

A ruined keep once had a purpose. Was it built to protect the region from invaders, house a ruler's vast wealth, or serve as an arcane laboratory? The keep's former purpose can inspire you with ideas about the creatures and objects that currently reside there. You can choose or roll for the purpose of a ruin on the Keep Former Purposes table.

##### Keep Former Purposes

### Flintmoth Swarm

When exploring a seemingly abandoned tower, if an adventurer hears an endless soft clatter like thousands of loose pebbles falling downhill, the ruin may be home to a flintmoth swarm. These elemental insects eat stone ruins over the course of centuries. Their wings are sharp and hard as flint, and their life cycles are measured in decades. Happy to remain near-motionless for months on end as they sustain themselves on stonework one minuscule mouthful at a time, flintmoths rarely move unless disturbed. When they do take flight, they must devour stone far more quickly to maintain their energy.

***Razor-Sharp Swarmers.*** The moth's stony wings offer both defense and offense. A single flintmoth is little threat to a humanoid, but hundreds or thousands fluttering past turn victims into mincemeat one tiny slice at a time.

***Nature's Newest.*** Flintmoths can eat natural rock, but they greatly prefer constructed stonework. If left unchecked for many years, a flintmoth infestation can destroy entire structures. The adaptable creatures often consume from the bottom up, slowly deteriorating stone sewers, dungeons, or cellars until the whole structure is at risk of collapse. Most active settlements control moth populations with a watchful eye, so massive swarms are usually found only in abandoned ruins.

### Lacuna

The lacuna ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Lacuna.html](lah-COON-ah)) feeds on the grief of abandoned places. First, this evil fiend feasts on emotions of lonely residents or mourners who come to pay their respects. The deaths of these victims begins a grief cycle that supplies the lacuna indefinitely with even more prey.

***Statue Stalkers.*** A lacuna takes the form of a cracked and crumbling statue, their face a mask frozen in an expression of unbearable sorrow. Whenever adventurers arrive in a lacuna's feeding ground, the fiend follows them for a time, reveling in any violence the visitors commit against other hostile creatures. But should the delvers find joy, perhaps while uncovering treasure or after surviving a difficult battle, the lacuna strikes, intent on inflicting and devouring misery.

***Half in Our World.*** Lacunas exist half in the Mundane World and half in whatever lower plane they originated from. This dual existence allows the lacuna to teleport at will and avoid harm.

### Thornblood

A thornblood grows from curse-empowered seeds embedded in a corpse. This enormous mass of living, thorny vines is a manifestation of nature's hate, and an antibody to the intrusion of civilization.

***Nature's Outrage.*** When a stone structure and its people intrude on nature's domain, a dying druid, dryad, or witch can utter a taboo curse, planting seeds in their own flesh. In death, a curse-bearer transforms themself into a thornblood rather than allow civilization a foothold in field or forest.

***Overgrown, Overwhelmed.*** As the corpse blooms into supernatural plant life, the thornblood quickly engulfs the area, untamable by flame or blade. The plants envelop everything in their path until the site where they grow is cleared of life. They then leave any encroaching corpses to rot where they lay. The curse-bearer remains beside those victims, their bones entwined with vines that are ready to rise again should intruders ever dare to return.

## Sewer

Deep beneath the city streets, winding tunnels holding murky waters have been built above decaying secrets. In this dripping darkness, strange creatures grow fatter—and deadlier—on the toxic byproducts of civilization.

### Sewer Traits

You can create a sewer version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- Low-Light Senses
- Used to Filth
- Of Unusual Size

### Sewer Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in a sewer by giving them the following lair actions:

Sewer Lair Actions

### Arcane Amalgam

An arcane amalgam forms when the polluted discards of magical experiments coalesce in sewers. These bits of unpredictable oils and tainted arcane energies form an oozing swarm of thumb-sized globules.

***Dormant Predators.*** Arcane amalgams gather in psychedelic clumps that lie still when no magic is about, though they spring to violence if disturbed by curious rodents or sewer workers. These translucent globs are easily overlooked while moving in small pools or resting in standing water.

***Magic-Fed.*** As arcane runoff passes near an amalgam, the swarm draws this in, expanding even further. On the rare occasion an amalgam encounters a spell or magic item, each drop springs to life with an eager mouth, seeking to consume anything—or anyone—magical within reach. Once the arcane amalgam has the scent of this magic, they mercilessly hunt their quarry.

***Trash to Treasure.*** The amalgam slowly digests their magic diet, becoming dormant again after eating their fill. Adventurers lucky enough to survive an encounter with one of these swarms might find valuable spell components or magic items among the remains.

### Stoneback Isopod

Stoneback isopods usually scavenge forest floors, but in the depths of urban sewers, they grow far more formidable than their rural counterparts. These mastiff-sized bugs seek out dark, humid places to feed on decaying plants, decomposing matter, or anything slow enough to catch. They lurk in running water, blending with stones in the channel—then when a delicious meal passes by, the isopod clamps down with powerful mandibles.

***Protective Carapace.*** When threatened, the stoneback isopod protects themself by curling the folds of their rocky carapace together into a sturdy defensive ball, granting them significant protection against attackers.

***Large Broods.*** Stoneback isopods lay huge tracts of eggs that hatch fully grown broods. They're rarely solitary, preferring to share plentiful feeding areas, then migrate as groups when food becomes scarce.

***Any Sewer Will Do.*** Stoneback isopods can survive in both bitter cold and scorching heat. Their diet of decaying matter makes them particularly adapted to sewers and urban living, where they can scavenge freely while sheltering in murky pools and drainage.

### Valochera

The valochera ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Valochera.html](val-OH-cherr-ah)) grows in the grime and muck of a city's waste. Once grown, this enormous yellow mushroom can plod through the sewers on their root-like mycelia. They constantly spew a dangerous cloud of spores from a gelatinous cap, which opens to reveal a hungry maw that devours liquefied prey.

***Hungry for Nutrients.*** While valocheras can squeeze nutrients out of any piece of organic matter, they prefer flesh—packed with nutritional goodness, it keeps them fed for days. In sewers, they most often feed on rats and bugs.

***Searing Stem and Smell.*** Before going in for the kill, the valochera releases foul-smelling spores that sicken prey. To finish the job, each valochera has mycelia that secrete acid to liquefy larger prey before consumption.

> ##### Gross Smells
>
>Sewers smell like poop. It's kind of their whole deal. You can use the following optional rule to help evoke the sewer's grossness and make it a more challenging environment for the player characters. At the end of each hour a character who needs to breathe spends in the sewer, they must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour or until they leave the sewer and remain outside of it for 10 minutes.

> ##### Fungus Creatures
>
>This book introduces a new Fungus tag, which you can see in the metadata line of some Plant stat blocks. At your discretion, you can add this tag to other creatures in the core rules, such as the violet fungus. This tag applies to some traits in this book, like the rotbeast's Forest Rot and Rotwake traits.
>
>We also implemented this tag for clarity. While science makes a distinction between fungi and plants, the game's core rules puts all fungus-based and plant-based creatures into the same Plant creature type. It makes sense that the official designers of the game wouldn't want to get too noodly with their creature types, but it turns out that many folks who are MCDM fans are also fungus fans! We had multiple people write to us and ask why we were calling fungi plants, so we decided a new tag would help clear things up.

## Swamp

*Whatever horrors you think you've seen in the world, they pale beside the nightmares birthed in the swamp.*Whether exploring forgotten ruins, seeking a rare herbal remedy, or facing a powerful black dragon, adventurers should beware the unknown when entering the damp, dense wilds of a swamp. These isolated biomes are neither patient nor forgiving to strangers.

### Swamp Traits

You can create a swamp version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- Acidic Nature
- Swamp Stride
- One with the Swamp

> ##### Swampy Terrain
>
>You can use this optional rule for combat encounters in swampy terrain. Swampy terrain is difficult terrain. If a creature without a swimming speed ends their turn without moving, they are restrained. A creature can use an action to make a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, freeing themself or another creature they can reach from the swampy terrain on a success.
>

### Swamp Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in a swamp by giving them the following lair actions:

Swamp Lair Actions

### Bog Body

Bog bodies are humanoid corpses that the swamp naturally mummified over several months. The process makes their skin tough and leathery, protecting them from harm and helping them to remain unseen in a dark, treacherous swamp. In many cases, the corpse's preservation means that at first glance, a bog body could easily be mistaken for a living person, with hair, skin, and even clothing still intact.

***An Endless Watch.*** Each time a swamp is threatened, a new set of bog bodies rises, adding to those awakened in the past. The older a swamp is, the more bog bodies it has. Some of the most ancient swamps have so many awakened bog bodies that passage is impossible for all but the most powerful visitors.

***Silent Stalker.*** Bog bodies use stealth to attack unwary intruders. They are adept at hiding in plain sight, blending in with plant life or submerging themselves fully in the murky water, then bursting out and taking their target by surprise.

### Marsh Hydra

Swamp hags, bog witches, and other mages of the wet places often eschew the stereotypical cat or bird familiar for something more evocative of their environment: snakes. For some, though, a snake—even a magically enhanced one—is too ordinary. These mages seek out ancient grafting spells and use them to create marsh hydras. This enormous monstrosity isn't a true hydra, but forms when a swarm of snakes is magically conglomerated into a single creature with multiple serpent heads.

***Cooperation is Key.*** Freshly created marsh hydras are nearly impossible to command, as the individual snake minds inside their body vie for dominance. Many never make it out of this stage, succumbing to infighting and ultimately proving too chaotic and violent to be useful servants. Such feral marsh hydras account for the majority of those encountered by adventurers. However, those marsh hydras who do learn to work together as a single organism can serve their creators capably.

***Concealed Heads.*** Though they sport multiple heads like a common hydra, the marsh hydra functions differently. Instead of regrowing heads as they are destroyed, a marsh hydra's body contains more heads beyond those initially seen on the outside. Though a marsh hydra rarely displays more than five or six heads at a time, some store as many as two dozen additional heads inside their body, depending on the ambition of their original creator. These internal heads can be rotated out and vice versa, allowing the creature to withstand even the most grievous wounds for a time.

### Rot Angel

Standing five to six feet tall, floating black-and-brown mushrooms move about the swamp like jellyfish, their thirteen prehensile eyestalks dangling beneath their cap. These rot angels are in fact celestials, typically serving gods of death in their search for the recently deceased. The touch of their stalk-like proboscises causes rapid decay in organic matter.

***Death's Cleanup Crew.*** Death gods send rot angels to remove all traces of a corpse from the world after that person's soul has been taken. A corpse decomposed by the touch of a rot angel can't be returned to life, made Undead, or otherwise supernaturally affected. The gods rarely explain why a given corpse requires a rot angel, and these angels don't ask.

***Dedicated Servants.*** Once a rot angel has been dispatched to a corpse, nothing short of death can dissuade them from completing their assignment. Should a rot angel be interrupted in their work, they have free rein to deal with the interruption in whatever way is required, up to and including the destruction of the disrupting forces.

### Swamp Dryad

Swamp dryads mirror the trees to which they are bound. Some stand uncannily tall, with twisting, elongated torsos easily mistaken for tree trunks. Others expand laterally, sporting up to six long arms dripping with moss.

***Bound by Choice.*** Unlike their more common cousins, swamp dryads begin life as mortals, usually as herbalists and other swamp dwellers who spent their lives becoming one with their home. Those who are clever, powerful, or lucky enough may meet an existing swamp dryad who teaches them the secret of binding. Though this process is arduous and can be fatal, a successful binding transforms the mortal into a fey and links them to their chosen tree. Once bound, the new fey and their tree share the same restrictions as a typical dryad.

***Reclusive and Territorial.*** After the binding, a swamp dryad's new connection to swamp flora and fauna leaves them with little desire to interact with people. As they would face great danger should their tree be harmed, swamp dryads are extremely distrustful of visitors.

***Valuable Allies.*** If the trust of a swamp dryad is earned, they can provide knowledge of the swamp and its paths, access to healing and other magic, and advice about avoiding or interacting with other swamp denizens. A swamp dryad ally can be the difference between life and death in this unfamiliar terrain.

**Bog Body**

**Marsh Hydra**

> ##### Big Ball of Snakes
>
>Before there was the marsh hydra, there was the big ball of snakes. When we first started working on the swamp environment, we created a creature that was just an enormous swarm of different snakes all entangled together in one ball, rolling through the swamp looking for a meal. This stat block was simply called the big ball of snakes.
>
>We had a lot of laughs about that idea but ultimately decided the big ball of snakes was just too silly for this particular book. The design team still really liked the stat block's mechanics, so we changed the lore and adjusted some language and, voilà, the marsh hydra was born.
>

**Rot Angel**

**Swamp Dryad**

## Underground

The vast cavernous depths of the World Below are places of danger and wonder, filled with odd denizens who have adapted to life in the dark. From skittering predators to deadly fungi, threats lurk in the shadows, ready to ambush unwary adventurers.

### Underground Traits

You can create an underground version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- Fungal Infestation
- Shadow Blend
- Underground Senses

### Underground Lair Actions

Underground Lair Actions

*Converter's Note: I thought about adding in the missing sentence here, but why bother? It's a copypasta from all of the other environmental lair action sections.*

### Deep Dreamer

A fine network of barbed black filaments supports the deep dreamer's fungal body, making them resemble a massive sinister dandelion. These plants drift through the air on gentle psionic currents, propelled by the spores they constantly release. As other creatures dream, the deep dreamer uses their filaments to feed on those creatures' psychic energy. A deep dreamer's influence can compel creatures to become lost in their dreams, never to wake up.

***Drifting Dreams.*** Deep dreamers seem perpetually lost in their own reverie, and collisions with solid objects often go unnoticed. When they do become aware of other creatures, they use their spores to share their strange dreams in hopes of stoking a creature's imagination and creating pleasant dreams to feed on.

***Sinister Bonds.*** Some deep dreamers unwittingly accumulate colonies of creatures who are permanently lost in dreams. These creatures follow their deep dreamers wherever they drift, lumbering after the fungus in a trance—and even jumping in front of the deep dreamer to save them from danger. Some of these creatures have been with their dreamers for so long that they're permanently tethered to one of the dreamer's filaments.

### Gem Jelly

Commonly found in caves where natural crystals grow, gem jellies secrete a digestive acid that breaks down rock and allows them to feed on the resulting minerals. Their diet gives them an iridescent sheen, and their bodies often reflect the colors of the crystals they feed on.

Though these oozes don't feed on other creatures, gem jellies are exceedingly territorial and attack intruders in their domains without hesitation.

***Crystal Mimicry.*** A gem jelly in its resting state resembles a natural formation of crystal—and often appears valuable to explorers. When approached by such interlopers, the jelly's true nature quickly becomes clear as they lash out with long crystal-barbed pseudopods.

***Psionic Organisms.*** Gem jellies are attuned to psychic energies and can send out pulses that resonate with the minds of other creatures. These pulses can be used to communicate simple concepts such as "food" or "danger." Some people believe gem jellies are actually sapient, and a few even set out to look for them in search of otherworldly wisdom. . . but most of these misguided pilgrims never return from their quest.

*Manifold 11, the World Below, into catacombs or tombs in search of remains to feast on. the Dark Under All, is a world of caves and wine-dark seas. There is no sky there—no sun.*— Remainer
### Leyleech

Leyleeches dwell in caverns near underground ley lines. These slug-like creatures feed on magic; when they sense its presence, they reach with their toothy maws to siphon off the energy and engorge themselves with its power. When a leyleech is full, the spines on their body arc with magical energy.

***Frenzied Taste.*** When leyleeches feed on natural ley line energy, they remain docile and complacent. However, the spells cast by living creatures drive leyleeches into a frenzy, prompting hungry attacks with little regard for the leyleech's own safety.

***Dormant Threats.*** While they aren't feeding, leyleeches curl up into rock-like cocoons that can be mistaken for boulders, and unwary travelers may find themselves sharing a resting place near a colony. These dormant leyleeches emerge hungry when they sense the presence of magic.

***Ley Line Siphons.*** When large colonies of leyleeches gather in a single area, their feeding can destabilize or even drain a ley line completely, affecting the way magic behaves in the immediate area. When several nearby colonies feed at once, it can affect a region miles wide.

### Marvorok

Marvoroks ([https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Marvorok.html](marr-VORR-ock)) are insidious predators who dwell in the deepest layers of the World Below, constantly searching for prey to sate their seemingly endless hunger. These monstrous bipedal beings sport six arms, four of which end in sharp, sword-like talons. Their eyesight is poor, but they make up for it with their incredible sense of smell that allows them to track by scent alone. Marvoroks use their claws to dig into rocky surfaces and pull themselves up, climbing as easily as they run.

***Silent Death.*** Remarkably stealthy for their massive size, marvoroks lie in wait for their prey before moving in for the kill. They wait patiently for the perfect ambush, leaping out from hiding and clawing their victims to pieces in a vulnerable moment.

***Solitary Hunters.*** Marvoroks prefer to lead solitary lives, coming together only to mate or to hunt particularly large or dangerous prey. When times are lean, they work together to drive creatures toward a common hunting ground where they can corner their prey. . . though this usually ends in fighting among themselves to determine who eats.

***Eaters of the Dead.*** Marvoroks aren't above scavenging for food, stripping rotten flesh from the bones of longdead creatures. Starving marvoroks even claw their way into catacombs or tombs in search of remains to feast on.

**Deep Dreamer**

> ##### Encountering a Deep Dreamer
>
>There are two typical setups for deep dreamer encounters. The first is a deep dreamer with a bevy of creatures charmed by the fungus who fight to protect the dreamer. The other is a lone dreamer floating in the darkness above the characters, releasing spores in an attempt to charm them before any fighting begins.
>

# Chapter 3: Villain Parties

This chapter presents seven villain parties in order of the threat they present in combat (see *"Optimized Party Level"*). As you introduce these villains to your game, keep the following guidance in mind.

## Portraying Villainy

All the parties in this section are explicitly villains. These characters aren't neutral mercenaries who can be negotiated with and possibly recruited. They're remorseless people who want to do bad—sometimes deeply awful—things. And in many cases, they do these things with glee. These are horrible people.

We believe that the more explicitly evil your villains are, the more motivated many players are to fight them—and the more triumphant players feel when their heroes win. But this is just a matter of taste, and many GMs and players aren't interested in that kind of fantasy. They might prefer a more relatable or comedic villain, or they might prefer adventures where the heroes are pitted against nature (although this book will be of little use in that event). We like those things too!

The creatures in this book all conform to a certain tone of realism and plausibility filtered through the lens of drama. But it's difficult for even this mighty tome to compete with real-world villainy in terms of sheer horrific evil—and some players don't want their games to compete like that. It's essential to know your table, talk to your players, and get a sense of what kinds of drama they enjoy and engage with. If you read these entries and find a villain's motives or methods too awful for your table, you have the option to reskin them, keeping their statistics and changing their fiction. We recommend using safety tools, like the ones found in the free MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit, to facilitate clear and concise communication with your players about anything that makes them or you uncomfortable.

This book took care of designing, testing, and balancing the powers and features of these villains. The way you use them now is up to you. If you like the implementation of the Black Iron Pact but find their bigotry gross, you could make them the leaders of a cult, a secret society trying to overthrow a beloved leader, or whatever makes sense for your world!

At the end of the day, this book is yours. These villains are yours. Use them however you see fit.

> ##### Individual Villains
>
>While the villain parties presented in this chapter are meant to fight the characters together, you can always have the heroes take on villains individually before the final showdown. Those individual fights should still be memorable, so give your villain a few henchmen, a cool consumable magic item, and a decent means of escape (or resurrection).
>

## Optimized Party Level

Each villain party is optimized to battle five characters of a specific level, as noted on the Villain Parties by Optimized Level table. These challenges were calculated assuming all members of the villain party are encountered in combat together. They're designed to give characters of the optimized level a fun challenge, especially if the heroes have already expended some resources on another encounter or two.

Each party's villains are meant to be fought together as a group. They are a difficult encounter for a party of the optimized level, so don't throw too many prelude encounters at your characters. They'll need all the spell slots, powerful features, and other resources they can get to survive!

##### Villain Parties by Optimized Level
| Optimized Level | Party           |   |
|:---------------:|-----------------|---|
|       3rd       | Grave Order     |
|       5th       | Abominations    |
|       7th       | Black Iron Pact |
|       9th       | Wilderkith      |
|       11th      | Amethyst Knife  |
|       13th      | Soulbinders     |
|       15th      | Hallowed Dark   |

## Villain Party Actions

Villain party actions work much like an action-oriented creature's villain actions (see *"Action-Oriented Creatures"* in the introduction), with the following changes:

- Instead of one creature having three villain actions, a party shares a pool of five villain party actions.
- Each villain party action is performed by a specific creature in the villain party, and each can be used once during an encounter after an enemy's turn.
- The party can take these actions in any order, but only one villain can use theirs each round.
- A villain action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.

Each party's section presents their villain actions in a recommended order for dramatic effect, often saving the most devastating for last. Odds are that you won't use every villain party action in a single encounter, as some creatures will be defeated before they get to use their action. That's okay! If every villain action were used in an encounter, it would be deadly indeed.

## Slow Burn

To create the most dramatic showdown with a villain party, you should build tension between the characters and their adversaries before it all goes down. Make the players eager for a chance to take down these wicked foes.

To start, have the characters learn about the evils of the villains firsthand before ever coming face to face with a member of the group. For instance, you could have the characters stumble upon the aftermath of the Wilderkith's destruction of a peaceful community before ever meeting the terrorists.

Then you should have the characters interact with lackeys of the villain party. They might even cross swords with one or two of the individual members of the party or see them from afar. Give the characters ample opportunity to ruin one or more of the party's plots and learn about each individual villain. The more information they gain and plans they foil, the better!

Eventually, after enough foiled plans at the hands of the characters, the villain party should strike back. This could be the moment of the final showdown if you're running a shorter game, or you could have the villain party hit the characters where it hurts. Just like the characters might be researching the villains, the evildoers look into the heroes. The villain party might raze a location important to the characters, harm or kidnap one of their NPC allies, or destroy or steal an object of great personal importance. The villains should make it clear they were the ones who did this and leave an obvious message for the characters that says something like, "Back off if you don't want more bad things to happen to everything you love."

After all this, if the characters haven't decided to take on the villains directly, then the evildoers bring the fight to them. They lay a trap and spring it the first chance they get, laying it all on the line to get rid of the characters who have caused them so much anguish.

## Grave Order

*Optimized for Five 3rd-Level Characters*

> ##### Content Warning: Enslaved Spirit, Body Horror, and Religious Desecration
>
>The spirit of an adventurer named Elyas Leodeir is imprisoned within the body of the Horror, an undead warrior animated by the Grave Order. If you don't want the imprisonment and enslavement of a spirit to play a role in your campaign, you can make the Horror a mindless undead creature instead. In addition, the Horror is a conglomeration of corpses; if anyone in your game is uncomfortable with that level of body horror, you can instead make the Horror an enormous zombie.
>
>Jedar Pike's backstory includes desecrating the bones of a saint. If religious desecration is a troubling plot point for your group, Jedar's profane ritual didn't require those components.
>

Rightfully reviled for their desecrations, the Grave Order's necromancers and gruesome creations seek power over the living by defiling the natural order of death. If left to perfect their insidious rituals and gather corpses, they will certainly descend on the Mundane World in a scourge of undeath.

### Background

The Grave Order serves no ambitions save their own. Each member was shunned for their unique blasphemies, but they otherwise escaped their crimes' consequences. Lestheris Soldrei gathered the group together so they could seize the world in an unliving grip.

Though the Grave Order's allies are few, they animate those they lack—whether that be powerful necrotic constructs or a horde of undead minions.

### Goals

Though each necromancer in the Grave Order has a unique dark dream, together they are committed to conquest through undeath. Condemned for their forbidden pursuits, the order also harbors festering grudges against those who vilified them. All who obstruct the Grave Order's aspirations will suffer a thousandfold in the glorious dead world to come.

Though these necromancers seek to animate an army, they're unsatisfied with the husks of mere commoners. The Grave Order unearths the graves of great heroes and reanimates their bones, flesh, or spirits. With the power of legends at their command, the Grave Order will topple kingdoms and strike fear into the hearts of their sworn enemies.

### Methods

The Grave Order roams the world, learning folklore to track down the graves of renowned heroes. They camp near graveyards and burial grounds. Under the cover of night, they are remorseless graverobbers, picking burial plots clean. They have no respect for local traditions or beliefs, using corpses as fodder to reach their true prize.

If discovered, the Grave Order shows no mercy to opposition. Meddlers just provide additional corpses—and all the better if those come from adventurers with dreams of glory and bleeding hearts.

### Halorin Yandres

**Halorin Yandres** trained for battle from his youth. After proving his dedication to the art of war, the human was assigned as a bodyguard to the brilliant young mage Lestheris Soldrei. When she showed Halorin kindness and trust, he repaid it in kind, sharing his darkest secrets with her.

Halorin supported his charge's macabre passions from the start—in part due to his devotion to her, but also driven by the euphoria he feels when a life slips away under his hand. The warrior enjoys killing in Lestheris's name, knowing his corpses help build the Grave Order.

When an adventuring group known as the Golden Valor sought to bring the order to justice, Halorin valiantly protected Lestheris and slew their foes before tragically succumbing to his wounds. The necromancer reanimated her bodyguard, preserving his mind in the process. Undeath hasn't tempered his bloodlust or his loyalty. For his dedication, Halorin leads the order's lesser undead in battle.

### Jedar Pike

A human apostate cleric, **Jedar Pike** serves a being called Vodor who claims to be a trapped and forgotten god of death. Vodor promised Jedar unimaginable power in exchange for freedom. To free his lord, Jedar defiled the bones of entombed saints for a profane ritual, only to be caught before he could complete the spell. His imminent execution was interrupted by Lestheris and Halorin, who cut their way through the guards and executioner to recruit Jedar into the Grave Order.

Jedar's cold and callous demeanor belies a fervent faith to Vodor. He excels in magics that manipulate bones, and he uses corporeal undead to defend and bolster his allies.

*The dead are so much easier to control than the living. Death will make you see things my way. Do not fight its embrace.*— Lestheris Soldrei
### Lestheris Soldrei

Treasured as a wizard prodigy in her youth, **Lestheris Soldrei** flourished under the protection and opportunities afforded her. As the half-elf grew into an insatiable arcane scholar, mentors assumed her academic interest in necromancy was mere morbid curiosity, but her fascination soon became experimentation with the forbidden. Lestheris dreamed of cheating death and ruling forever—a privilege she believed the universe owed her brilliance—and her devoted bodyguard Halorin only encouraged her ambitions.

Lestheris's teachers finally saw the evil in her and forbade any further dalliances with necromancy. But the young mage had already tasted power, and she killed her ignorant teachers and took their spellbooks.

Determined to become a lich and rule the Mundane World forever, Lestheris founded the Grave Order, gathering other necromancers to work toward her grand vision. While she is skilled in all aspects of necromancy, Lestheris specializes in the incorporeal: subjugating spirits, binding souls, and empowering her magic with such essences.

### Mycete

A peculiar tiefling with a distracted air, **Mycete**'s body is crisscrossed with yellow veins of a beautiful parasitic fungus. She has developed a symbiotic relationship with her fungus, which she adores and has named Amber Decay. Mycete dreams of cultivating a garden to cover the entire world—a dream that quickly put her at odds with the people of her home village, for this fungus grows best in the dying bodies of humanoids ... and if those bodies are later reanimated, it continues to thrive in their undead husks.

After Mycete was caught slaughtering neighbors to serve as zombified hosts for her blossoms, the villagers captured the necromancer, planning to burn her and her creations. The Grave Order intervened by killing the villagers, saving Mycete, and bringing her into their fold. She specializes in cultivating Amber Decay in the cavities of undead and spreading it across the field of battle, hindering and enervating her foes.

### The Horror

**The Horror** is a distended construct of stitched skin and grafted limbs bearing weapons made from sharpened bone. The Grave Order stitched this creation together from the corpses of the Golden Valor, an adventuring party who dared to challenge the necromancers. They then bound the soul of Elyas Leodeir—a cunning rogue who killed Halorin and earned Lestheris's personal ire—to the grotesque form.

Ensorcelled by Lestheris's magic, Elyas is forced to fight against his will from within the prison made of his former friends. This implacable avatar of death and destruction is the greatest of the Grave Order's undead creations, and the first harbinger of the necromancers' future army.

### Magic

Halorin wears the *pendant of grave regeneration*, a gift from Lestheris after his reanimation. Lestheris carries the *Tome of the Ethereal*.

### Grave Order Villain Actions

The Grave Order has five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.

- **Action 1: Bulwark of Bone.** Jedar animates four **decrepit skeleton**s, who appear in unoccupied spaces he can see within 30 feet of him. The skeletons act immediately after Jedar on the same initiative count and follow his verbal orders. If Jedar dies, the skeletons are destroyed.
- **Action 2: Forward Assault.** Halorin commands each allied Undead minion within 30 feet of him who can hear him. Each target can move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Action 3: Threshing Flail.** The Horror moves up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. When the Horror ends that movement, they whirl their bone hook around them, and each enemy within 30 feet of them must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
- **Action 4: Fungal Paradise.** Mycete chooses one or more **rotting zombie**s under her control who she can see within 30 feet of her. Each chosen zombie is destroyed and explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area of one or more explosions must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The ground in each explosion's area then becomes covered with fungal growth, as if affected by Mycete's Fungal Growth action. If Mycete controls no rotting zombies within 30 feet, she instead uses her Animate Husks, even if it's unavailable, without expending a use of it.
- **Action 5: The Tide of Death.** Lestheris animates a number of **shade**s equal to the number of enemies she can see within 30 feet of her. Each shade appears within 30 feet of her in an unoccupied space she can see. The shades act immediately after Lestheris on the same initiative count and follow her verbal orders. If Lestheris dies, the shades are destroyed.

*I gave my life for Lestheris. She gave it back to me–plus a little something more. Your corpse will be mine to command.*— Halorin Yandres
> ##### Golden Valor
>
>The Golden Valor fell when they dared to face the Grave Order. Now their corpses make up the Horror. This group of adventurers was known for hunting bandits and small demon cults when they decided to take on the Grave Order. Their members included the following heroes:
>
>- Elyas Leodeir, a half-elf rogue
>- Gar Tailhooks, a dwarf barbarian
>- Olliandra Fenwick, a human ranger
>- Scrubias Nackvar, a gnome wizard
>- Willis Tormack, a human paladin

## Abominations

*Optimized for Five 5th-Level Characters*

> ##### Content Warning: Body Horror, Torture, Cannibalism, and Eugenics
>
>The Abominations enjoy butchering, torturing, and devouring humanoids, and each Abomination's body has been stitched together from various humanoid and animal parts. If this would make the game unfun for your group, you can make the Abominations appear more natural (or magical) rather than grotesque. You can similarly skip the descriptions of them butchering bodies, eating people, and other violent and gory details.
>
>The Abominations' origin story involves countless rounds of experimentation on sapient creatures followed by the murder of any creations deemed "imperfect." If this is hurtful for anyone in your game, you could decide that N'shalla and Evae's earlier creations were unable to live for more than a short time (if at all), or simply skip the experimental batches entirely.
>

You think you've lost them. It's dark and raining, and they were still cramming chunks of elf flesh in their mouths when you fled. But as you catch your breath, your mind explodes in pain, driving you to your knees. The animal-headed predators huddle around you, licking chops and cackling with hungry glee. The Abominations have eaten everyone else. Now they're going to eat you.

### Background

Perhaps some evil deity brought the Abominations' creators together. Maybe it was just a cruel trick of fate. After their respective orders exiled them for magical experimentation on unwilling subjects, the druid N'shalla and the mage Evae Yawn crossed paths—and instantly fell in love. With their passions and forbidden knowledge combined, the twisted pair took up their dark work.

Determined to create bloodthirsty monsters who would exact revenge on the lovers' old organizations, N'shalla and Evae produced batch after batch of monstrosities, destroying any they considered less than perfect. Evae began each reation by growing a lifeless humanoid husk from raw materials, and N'shalla replaced its head and limbs with wild animal parts. Then together, they gave the monsters life ... and when the creatures inevitably proved flawed, the evil lovers ended them and started over yet again. After ten years of failure, Evae and N'shalla finally believed themselves victorious—they had created a band of five creatures who seemed the ultimate combination of strength, beauty, ferocity, and cold intelligence. But the monstrosities weren't obedient. They were hungry.

N'shalla's final words before being torn apart were, "You are not our children. You are abominations!" After devouring both creators, their children remained hungry. They went hunting.

### Goals

The Abominations have one goal—consume the flesh, organs, and bones of powerful humanoids. They zealously believe this makes them stronger, both physically and spiritually. The obsessed predators have no other hobbies or interests. There is only the next hunt.

### Methods

The monstrosities set up camp outside of humanoid settlements, observing the population for days before selecting the most worthy meal. Adventurers make the finest meat, for they hold great power—and few common folk investigate the deaths of heroes with a dangerous lifestyle. The Abominations have a particular taste for those who practice arcane or nature magic, as it reminds them of their first meal. Such prey is slowly and ritualistically sacrificed, taken apart and devoured joint by joint.

The villains typically wait patiently for prey to venture out of a city or town before striking, but if a target is particularly tempting, they're willing to risk sneaking into a settlement at night. They kidnap and later enjoy their meals together in a safe location, rather than eating victims on the spot, and they never stay in a single hunting ground for long. While traveling from one city to the next, they eat waylaid travelers and errant farmers, though this is far from their preferred diet.

### Boog

Standing over ten feet tall with a powerful frame, **Boog** enjoys slaughter and destruction. They sport the head of a rhinoceros, the legs of an elephant, and the arms of a gorilla. Common sense isn't Boog's strong suit and their methods lack subtlety, but they're inarguably effective in battle: Boog charges forward, hits their target until dead or subdued, then moves on to the next.

Boog only speaks in two-word phrases beginning with "Boog": Boog smash. Boog kill. Boog gorge. Because of their large size and lack of subtlety, Boog remains at camp with Ceemal during reconnaissance missions. Ceemal dotes on Boog during these times, and the big monster has begun to treat Ceemal as a child treats a parent.

### Ceemal

**Ceemal** serves as the group's spiritual advisor and butcher. They have the head and back hump of a camel, and the striped legs and rear hooves of a zebra. Though their front limbs show off a camel's cloven hooves, those hooves function as humanoid hands. Thanks to veins infused with octopus blood, Ceemal can easily blend in with their surroundings when danger is close.

Ceemal doesn't go on hunts with the other Abominations, preferring to remain in camp and prepare to break down captured prey. When the Abominations are together, Ceemal looks after the others like a concerned parent, keeping the peace and doting on their friends as seconds are served. Boog holds a particularly special place in Ceemal's heart.

Thanks to their gleaming, wide eyes and nonthreatening herbivore body parts, it's easy to mistake Ceemal for a kind, innocent creature—but as victims beg them for mercy, Ceemal's only response is a precise slice to the jugular from a sharp knife.

### Excess

A monstrous hybrid with an enlarged viper head, scorpion tail, and four giant spider legs, **Excess**'s appearance terrifies most who encounter them. But the real horror begins when Excess enlarges their head and torso to swallow a humanoid whole.

The sneakiest of the Abominations, Excess can squeeze into tight spaces and climb up sheer walls and ceilings with no equipment. They reconnoiter for the group in sewers, caves, and other dank and dark places.

While they enjoy hunts with their family, Excess is the most independent of the group. They sometime seek their own meal, relishing the challenge of a solo, stealthy pursuit.

### Klar

While Ceemal looks after the Abominations' comforts, **Klar** leads the hunt. With the noble head of a lion, Klar poses as a heroic celestial being and lures in victims with sweet words, then bisects them with razor-sharp mantis claws. They bound on kangaroo legs through the battlefield, striking enemies then retreating.

Klar also has the shrunken lungs of a whale, the gills of a fish, and the syrinx of a songbird. They can make a variety of unique sounds and noises to distract or frighten enemies.

Recently, Klar has taken an interest in many victims' obsession with prayer, especially in the moments before death. Wondering if the Abominations might be part of some divine creator's plan, Klar even defers their insatiable hunger to discuss divinity and creation with captives. But no victim is so engaging that they avoid Klar's maw forever.

### Sair

Called the Flying Mind Screamer by the rare survivors of Abomination attacks, **Sair** has the wings and tail of a dragon, the feet of a dinosaur, and the head of an owl. From the sky, they scout prey and find new hunting grounds.

Sair's creators imbued psionic abilities in the flying Abomination. Sair uses these gifts to confuse prey, herding them into the waiting claws of their siblings.

Among the Abominations, Sair is particularly cruel and is often scolded by Ceemal for playing with their food. The winged Abomination loves to taunt their prey before death, sometimes taking victims up to the sky and threatening to drop them.

### Magic Items

Boog carries a magic sphere claimed from a slain wizard, which the Abominations call *Boog's ball*. At camp, Ceemal always keeps a supply of *poison popper*s gathered from N'Shalla's garden.

*Boog's Ball*

*Poison Popper*

### Abominations Villain Actions

The Abominations have five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.

- **Action 1: Aerial Transport.** Sair moves up to twice their speed. Before or during this move, they can pick up and carry one willing Large Abomination or up to two willing Medium or smaller Abominations who are within 5 feet of them. Sair can release a carried Abomination at any point during the move and must release all carried Abominations at the end of the move. If an Abomination is released while 10 feet or more above the ground, they fall and land prone, taking the normal 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.
- **Action 2: Hypnotize.** Excess's eyes turn white as they sway from side to side. Each creature in a 15-foot cone emanating from Excess must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Excess until the start of Excess's next turn. While charmed in this way, a creature's speed is 0.
- **Action 3: All You Can Meat.** Ceemal opens the pouch on their waist and throws a chunk of meat to each Abomination they can see within 30 feet of them. Each target who isn't incapacitated can consume the meat and regain 8 (1d10 + 3) hit points (no action required).
- **Action 4: Come and Get It.** Klar moves up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks and makes up to two Mantis Claws attacks. Then each Abomination within 30 feet of Klar who can hear them can move up to their speed toward Klar without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Action 5: Boog Stomp.** Boog stomps the ground furiously. Each enemy on the ground within 30 feet of Boog must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and falling prone on a failed save, or taking half as much damage and not falling prone on a successful one.

> ##### Abominations in Disguise
>
>Even the stealthiest Abominations have trouble navigating cities to find their next meal or sneak up on the characters while they stay at an inn. If you want the Abominations to enter settlements without setting off alarms, consider giving them access to illusion or transmutation magic, a magic item such as a *hat of disguise*, or other features that can allow them to walk freely among people—including the characters—without notice.
>

**Boog**

*Boog hunt. Boog chase. Boog crush! Boog eat. . . Boog hungry.*— Boog**Ceemal**

*Hello, traveler. Have a seat by the fire. My friends should be back any minute, and then it's dinner time. Won't you please join us? I'm sure you're dying to know what I am.*— Ceemal**Excess**

**Klar**

**Sair**

> ##### Sair's Got Range
>
>Sair's flying speed paired with the 120-foot range of them Psionic Bolt attack means they never need to engage the characters in melee. While most groups have at least a few characters with far-reaching spells and weapons, there are some that may find it frustrating if Sair just keeps attacking from an unreachable position. If you're running the Abominations against a group that is mostly focused on melee and short-range attacks, give them a fighting chance and have Sair stay closer to the ground.

## Black Iron Pact

*Optimized for Five 7th-Level Characters*

> ##### Content Warning: Body Horror, Torture, Cannibalism, and Eugenics
>
>The Black Iron Pact embraces a particularly heinous ideology centered on racism and sexism. Because this evil exists in the real world, roleplaying the Black Iron Pact could make the game unsafe and unfun for some players. Discuss these topics with your group before running the Black Iron Pact to gauge their enthusiasm for taking on such villains. Some players may be eager to take down these bigots, while for others, the injustice might hit too close to reality. You can always change the motivations of the Black Iron Pact, perhaps making them cultists who want to claim the greatest city in the world for a tyrannical deity. That's an evil enough agenda for most heroes to take action!
>

Racist zealots who wrongly believe in the superiority of humans, the Black Iron Pact conspires in secret to overthrow the multicultural traditions of Capital—proclaimed by its cosmopolitan populace as "the greatest city of this or any age." In their place, the pact plans to institute a harsh theocracy ruled by Ajax the Invincible, the Iron Saint.

### Background

A secret society created to overthrow Capital's political and cultural structure, the Black Iron Pact draws its name from Ajax's sobriquet, the Iron Saint. Iron is a metal with deep symbolism to the tyrannical saint.

The five most powerful members of the pact—the High Command—formally lead the society and serve as its strike team. The identity and whereabouts of the Black Iron Pact's original founder are closely guarded secrets, known only to Ajax and the High Command.

The pact's true numbers also remain a mystery, and many citizens work for them unknowingly. Such subterfuge ensures the pact's agents can't be traced back to the High Command.

### Goals

The Black Iron Pact's primary goal is the conquest of Capital and the installation of Ajax as its ruler and god. The pact's agents are true believers of Ajax's gospel, which seeks change through force and violence. Their evil belief is that humans are the true owners of this world, and as such, only humans can join the Black Iron Pact, though the society employs nonhuman pawns when risk of capture or death is high. Additionally, many members of the pact—notably senior member Erasmus and his wife Avalla—openly sneer at the idea of guilds (essentially scorning everyone in the middle class), and they object to anyone but a human man holding public office, owning any assets, or even learning to read.

To achieve Ajax's conquest, the pact seeks the location of Ringwell, a long-lost ancient repository of powerful and dangerous items from a fallen empire. They intend to plunder the vault and deliver the greatest artifacts to Ajax.

### Methods

The High Command maintains a private demiplane known as the Cyst, a small worldlet only a few miles across which senior members can access through magic items called the *iron ring*s (see "Magic Items" later in this entry). The Cyst is both a stronghold and a staging area for the pact's combat missions, though most rank-and-file members don't know of its existence.

The leaders of the High Command deal with their enemies as a team, bringing overwhelming force to any conflict. They don't allow any survivors who might report their existence, since High Command includes nobles and guild leaders whose membership in this cult must remain secret.

The Black Iron Pact enacts their plans only after meticulous research and forethought. When members of the High Command assault an objective, they catch their enemies unaware and unprepared, ensuring victory. If things go awry, they can retreat using an *iron ring*.

### Lord Erasmus Deseo

First among equals in the High Command of the Black Iron Pact, **Lord Erasmus Deseo** is the thirteenth Earl Deseo, a minor house under the patronage of House Navarr, Capital's oldest noble family. He represents a small but influential group of Capital nobles who have racist and sexist views.

Aside from the mysterious founder of the pact, Erasmus is its most senior member. He enjoys the camaraderie and has surrounded himself with like-minded people. From his point of view, the pact's vile ideals are popular. Even in polite company, he spits his bigoted views aloud. Though the room is typically divided between those who openly agree and those who remain silent, he's confident even the latter agree with him—for how could anyone disagree with the "facts" that seem so obvious to him? In his warped, evil mind, people who openly speak of equal justice and liberty for all are just pandering to fashion; privately, all wise people surely know this is an Age of Men. Erasmus is so enamored with his own misguided ideals that he doesn't notice how most people barely hide their disgust for him—some out of politeness, others out of fear of the lord's power.

### Canon Athenodorus

After moving to Capital as a teen, **Canon Athenodorus** the Unalloyed joined the Church of Saint Pellario the Aspirant, eventually rising to become a mid-level church official. While he publicly preaches the words of Saint Pellario, patron saint of ambition, he privately works to convert his fellows to the Church of Ajax. According to him, several Knights of the Black Glove—an order sponsored by the Church of Saint Pellario—are sympathetic to Ajax's tyrannical teachings.

The Knights of the Black Glove are considered the greatest in Capital. If Athenodorus could indeed convert them to allies of the Black Iron Pact, Ajax's conquest of Capital would be all but assured.

### Cloak

The High Command's master of assassins, **Cloak**'s identity is a carefully guarded secret. She approached Lord Erasmus Deseo and demanded entry into the society after discovering the identity of the High Command and making her way into the Cyst without an *iron ring*. The brash move so impressed the leader of the Black Iron Pact that he accepted her offer and terms of anonymity.

Cloak plans the Black Iron Pact's operations alongside Lord Erasmus. It is usually Cloak who gathers intelligence, pays people off, and ensures there are no surprises or hidden variables when the High Command strikes. Their victories can largely be credited to her immaculate preparation. Members of the High Command speculate that Cloak is a highly ranked and well-connected member of one of the major guilds in the city.

### Lady Avalla Deseo

Lady Avalla Deseo, wife of Lord Erasmus, helped shape the Black Iron Pact's sinister rhetoric, especially where it concerns women. She preaches these backward ideals about gender passionately and defers to her husband at home and in the Cyst.

The fact that Avalla is also a high-ranking wizard at the Imperial College of Sorcery and possessed of great knowledge and authority doesn't seem at all contradictory to her (or her husband). Many of her colleagues have no respect for her views, but her power can't be denied. Students quickly learn that those who brashly question Avalla's evil ideals get kicked out of the college for fabricated reasons.

Through great toil and experimentation, Avalla has modified her *iron ring* to be more useful. She can activate it quickly in times of distress and use it to transport other members of the pact who wear the ring.

### Qar, Master of Jackals

**Qar** boarded the *Priceless Pearl* when the Riojan caravel docked in the port city of Kom-nefer in Khemhara. He served for many years as a warrior and sailor, until he and his shipmates battled powerful sorcerers aboard the *Ainsurabaloc*. Qar found himself alone and unarmed, facing a monk from Higara with tattoos of demonic jackals covering her skin. By a stroke of luck, Qar defeated the monk and unwittingly absorbed her power, title, and technique. Now Qar is the Master of Jackals.

He left the service of the *Priceless Pearl* when they next docked in Capital, joining the District Watch. Using his ill-gotten abilities, he rose to the rank of captain. Following a particularly brutal encounter on the street, Qar was quoted in the broadsheets saying, "The smell and filth of the city are overwhelming." This brought him to the attention of the Black Iron Pact, and Lord Deseo personally recruited him for the High Command.

Qar takes special delight in unnecessary cruelty, and on the battlefield, he uses his mobility to kill unconscious foes where they lie before allies can heal them.

### Magic Items

All members of the High Command of the Black Iron Pact wear an *iron ring*. Athenodorus wields the *star of iron*.

*Iron Ring*

*Star of Iron*

### Black Iron Pact Villain Actions

The Black Iron Pact has five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.

- **Action 1: Party Tactics.** Qar and each ally within 60 feet of him who can see or hear him can move up to their speed.
- **Action 2: Curse of Iron.** Athenodorus unleashes a magic hex. Each enemy he can see within 30 feet of him must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and is blinded for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.
- **Action 3: Promised Storm.** Avalla fires a bolt of lightning at a creature she can see within 90 feet of her. The bolt then leaps from that target to up to two other creatures of her choice within 30 feet of the first target. Each target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Action 4: Assassin's Strike.** Cloak moves up to her speed then makes a Shortsword attack against a creature within her reach. On a hit, the attack deals 33 (6d10) piercing damage instead of its normal damage, and it doesn't inflict the poisoned condition. On a miss, the attack deals half as much damage.
- **Action 5: Playtime's Over.** Erasmus barks a command to a member of the High Command within 60 feet of him who can hear him. The target can use their villain party action even if they have already used it during this encounter.
- 
> ##### Retreat to the Cyst
>
>Each member of the Black Iron Pact's High Command can use their *Iron Ring* action to teleport out of a losing battle. You can utilize this action the first time one or more of the villains is cornered by the characters and needs a quick exit. This display will make the characters aware of how the members of the Black Iron Pact can teleport out of danger, giving the characters a chance to prepare countermeasures for the next encounter. When fighting together, the members of the High Command generally don't retreat until at least one of them has fallen.

>We have intentionally left the identity of **Cloak** a mystery so that you can better work the Black Iron Pact into your campaign's story. She might be an NPC who is close to the characters and has been spying on them since their arrival in Capital. She could be a secret hero working to take the Black Iron Pact down from the inside. She might be a wealthy noble or politician who trusts no one, not even Erasmus, to keep her involvement in the heinous organization a secret.

> ##### Content Warning: Terrorism
>
>The Wilderkith are evil villains who use fear to advance their agenda. They not only destroy structures built by expansive civilizations, but they kill indiscriminately to force people to flee cities. If you or your players don't enjoy playing games with terrorism, you can have the Wilderkith plan their attacks more strategically and surgically. Have them wait until a building is empty before demolishing it, and only kill the powerful politicians and leaders who push for expansion, mining, and cutting down trees.
>

Some see nature as all-encompassing chaos. Others believe it a precious balance. And some believe nature walks among us with a bloody vision—a future free of human civilization. This incarnation is Anthracia, a dryad bent on revenge. She leads a force of nature's bloody avengers that she calls the Wilderkith.

### Background

When mortals felled the first forest in the Mundane World to make way for a road, Anthracia laid waste to them for daring to harm the natural world. For her crime, a council of archfey imprisoned her in the Gemhollow—an ancient crystal deep in Arcadia, the realm of fey. For millennia, she watched as civilizations sprang up and hurt nature in their attempts to tame it. Her rage and desire for vengeance festered until a group of curious elves broke her free.

The vengeful dryad appealed to the elves, plants, and forest fey to help her save the Mundane World from humanoid expansion. Those who saw wisdom in the dryad's words left Arcadia with Anthracia to begin a bloody campaign.

### Goals

The Wilderkith's Inner Circle leads an army to destroy civilization's blight, razing roads, dams, farms, and even schools. To this band, burning a city is an act of pure good, as the ash makes way for the next generation of plants so the cycle of nature can continue.

The Wilderkith despise those who cut down trees, dig mines, or otherwise try to tame or take from the land. Their doctrine holds no hope for such people, believing them destined to destroy themselves and the world around them.

Ultimately, the Wilderkith know they aren't as powerful as all the major civilizations of the Mundane World. Their vandalism alone can't turn the tide, but no other group possesses the courage to end the disease of civilization. The Wilderkith seek any power that can help them restore untamed wilderness, rule over it, and prevent the rise of future civilizations.

### Methods

The Wilderkith rely on guerilla warfare, using their understanding of the land to their advantage. They strike poorly defended settlements in the dead of night, destroying all they can before retreating into the forest, then back to the Gemhollow. This crystal prison once held Anthracia, but the Wilderkith turned it into a fortress—one they can ritually summon to a new location.

Occasionally, the Wilderkith set their sights on bigger targets, using destruction to send a message to those who think they're safe behind tall stone walls. Rapid plant growth reclaiming fresh ruins is a common Wilderkith calling card.

### Anthracia, Princess of Venom

Captivating to her followers and cruel to her enemies, the dryad **Anthracia** delights in the demise of those she sees as a threat to the beasts and plants of the wilderness. To the self-styled Princess of Venom, murder is a simple part of the natural cycle. The beings who serve her are spared her wrath only because of their connection to the natural world, but she feels all her followers are ultimately expendable.

Anthracia's dryad tree is hidden deep inside Gemhollow. She zealously guards the tree, allowing no other creature but Logger into the chamber.

Anthracia controls the battlefield from afar, using her supernatural connection to the earth to lock down terrain and manipulate the movement of enemies and allies.

### Logger

Made from the vines and branches of Anthracia's tree, **Logger** dutifully follows the dryad like a puppy. The humaniform plant has never left her side and was imprisoned with Anthracia for thousands of years.

Logger's docile demeanor cracks into violent rage when Anthracia commands them to attack. Once set loose, the plant can be hard to control; imbued with the wild fury of nature itself, they're prone to rampaging and trampling friend and foe alike.

Logger excels at diving into combat headfirst, ready to soak up damage for the Wilderkith and pin down as many targets as possible.

### Sylphise

Ethereal, unsettling, and above all alien, **Sylphise** serves as Anthracia's second-in-command. Those who glimpse this forest nymph recall the sight with more fear than awe, retelling a riveting nightmare of impossibly long limbs, taloned fingers, and wide, soul-piercing eyes.

Sylphise treats most other creatures as insects beneath her notice or toys for her amusement. Even elves and fey find her hard to fathom, and many whisper to each other that the nymph's chaotic nature is a liability—but none would suggest this to Anthracia, as the dryad and nymph are utterly committed to each other.

And no one can argue with her results on the field. Sylphise strikes fast as a snake, weaving through combat like a dancer, leaving terror in her wake.

### Tuval-Uthriar

**Tuval-Uthriar** was once a proud commander of a paladin order, but after a land baron invaded his family's ancient lands and killed his son, he left his post to train Anthracia's forces. The elf took a new oath, swearing to become an instrument of vengeance against the hubris of civilization. He is the newest member of the Inner Circle, and has lived his whole life in the Mundane World.

The veteran tactician believes in the Wilderkith's mission to destroy humanity and thus prevent the slow decay of the natural world. However, when ordered to harm another elf, he can't help but see his family's faces, and he struggles to obey.

In addition to Tuval-Uthriar's limited healing abilities, he supports the Wilderkith by drawing fire and forming a solid front line.

### Vali

A once-celebrated hunter condemned by his people for fratricide, **Vali** serves as a prized scout and assassin for the Wilderkith. The elf excels at picking off enemies from the treetops with his magic longbow.

Vali took a vow of silence after his excommunication, but his face is etched with a clear set of priorities. He lives for the kill and feels happiest while watching a body topple. Each death never comes fast enough for the bloodthirsty assassin.

In combat, Vali is hard to find and harder to hit. He has plenty of options for getting out of a tight spot, making him a particularly slippery damage-dealer.

### Magic Items

Tuval-Uthriar wields a magic gauntlet called *eye of sunrise*, and Vali wields a magic longbow called *waning moon*.

*Eye of Sunrise*

*Waning Moon*

### Wilderkith Villain Actions

The Wilderkith have five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.

- **Action 1: Liquid Earth.** Each creature within 60 feet of Anthracia must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be moved by her up to 15 feet horizontally. A target can choose to fail this saving throw.
- **Action 2: Distracting Tendrils.** Logger waves their tendrils wildly. Each enemy within 30 feet of them must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 22 (4d10) slashing damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the target's next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.
- **Action 3:  Blood-Soaked Daisies.** Sylphise moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks. She can make one Claw attack against each enemy she passes within 5 feet of during this move.
- **Action 4: Tactical Push.** Tuval-Uthriar shouts a command. Each member of the Inner Circle within 60 feet of him who can hear him can make an attack or move up to their speed (no action required).
- **Action 5: Suppressing Volley.** Vali makes a ranged attack against each enemy he can see within 150 feet of him, and each member of the Inner Circle can move up to their speed and take the Hide action (no action required).

**Anthracia, Princess of Venom**

**Logger**

> ##### What is Logger?
>
>Logger is a one-of-a-kind plant creature created by Anthracia from the branches of her tree. Only Anthracia truly understands the magic used to create the plant, but some theorize that if Anthracia's tree were destroyed, Logger would die as a result. To lose both her tree and Logger in the same blow would surely push Anthracia toward revenge at all costs.

## Amethyst Knife

*Optimized for Five 11th-Level Characters*

After an adventuring expedition went wrong, the adventurers attained strange psionic powers. Using their newfound abilities, they built the criminal syndicate known as the Amethyst Knife. Striving to become one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations across the known world, the syndicate's ruthless and selfish leaders manipulate rival factions, heads of state, and other powerful individuals to place them under the syndicate's sway.

### Background

Five years ago, famed halfling actor and adventurer Harlo Honeygrin put together an expedition to seek an ancient ruin and its rumored relics of an alien civilization. Harlo and his expedition discovered a dagger made of a purple crystal unlike anything they had seen before. When they removed the strange weapon from its stone dais, thunderous energy collapsed the vault and shattered the dagger, releasing an explosive pulse of violet psionic power.

After recovering from the blast and escaping the ruins, the five survivors found they had acquired strange new powers and a shared telepathic link. With this new development, Harlo revealed his true nature as the head of a small criminal organization. He convinced the others to use their new powers to help grow and expand his group's influence—in exchange for a share of the profits and power, of course. They renamed the organization after the strange alien relic that had gifted them new powers and opportunities, and together, they reforged Harlo's small criminal enterprise into a blossoming underworld syndicate.

### Goals

The Amethyst Knife seeks three things above all: wealth, influence, and control. They're willing to acquire these through any means necessary, caring little for who gets hurt or what must be sacrificed in the process. To the Knife, the ends always justify the means.

The syndicate is always expanding their network of spies, informants, and in-pocket influential figures. Most recently, the Amethyst Knife set their sights on the noble houses of the great port city of Capital, dispatching spies and underlings to infiltrate those houses and discover new opportunities.

### Methods

The Amethyst Knife builds its wealth in every criminal scheme imaginable: smuggling, protection fees, assassination contracts, and more. Its bosses then invest the money from these criminal enterprises into legitimate businesses—which prove remarkably profitable, thanks to the Knife coercing local leaders to make favorable laws and scaring the competition out of the game.

While the bosses of the Amethyst Knife let nothing stand in their way, they avoid attracting too much attention. The group uses subterfuge and pawns to avoid the ire of law enforcement and so-called heroes. Bribing or blackmailing prominent figures, subverting laws and contracts, threatening loved ones, and manipulating marks into desperate situations are all common tactics.

When subtle manipulations fail, the Amethyst Knife strikes their foes with swift, merciless violence. Minor threats and obstacles can be resolved with freelance assassins or mercenaries, but serious opposition merits intervention from the Knife's bosses. Using their psionic powers, shared minds, and varied skill sets, they wait for a vulnerable moment. If an attack goes awry, the Amethyst Knife fades into the shadows to find a better approach—such as slowly picking off a rival group one by one.

### Harlo Honeygrin

Though **Harlo Honeygrin** approaches his one hundred and twentieth birthday, he retains his appearance as a halfling man in the prime of youth with exceptional good looks. His public image paints him as a charming, heroic lover of the arts, but in truth, Harlo is a jealous, spiteful reprobate who secretly created a criminal enterprise to fulfill his vain and desperate needs.

Over eighty years ago, Harlo forged a deal with Barresqueth, an archfey who offered the destitute halfling fame, power, and beauty in exchange for a payment of treasure every three years. After forging the pact, Harlo built the life of theater and adventure he'd always wanted—but when his first payment came due, Harlo learned Barresqueth would increase the price every three years. As the fee grew, Harlo resorted to criminal means to obtain it.

Each time Barresqueth collects the debt from Harlo, the archfey assumes the guise of a swashbuckling mouse with an eyepatch. Passersby assume the little rodent is Harlo's adorable fey friend, which only irks the halfling more as he forks over a sack of riches to the greedy little mouse.

Harlo maintains his life as a famous actor, using it to build connections within the societies the Knife seeks to control. When forced into action, he uses his powers from hiding while the other bosses go toe-to-toe with opponents.

### Jutkarr Flintfingers

Though **Jutkarr Flintfingers** is a devotee of Ragilo, a god venerated by thieves and assassins, he doesn't consider himself a scoundrel. In fact, the grandfatherly dwarf actively dislikes most thieves, calling them lazy cheats and cocky liars. Jutkarr instead considers himself a "problem solver" and believes that any true follower of Ragilo is the same. To him, there's little difference between solving the daily word puzzle in the city broadsheet and "solving" a guarded mansion, a warded treasure vault, or the social complexities of a street gang war. Each is merely a pleasant distraction and chance to keep his wits sharp.

Harlo hired Jutkarr for his expedition as an expert intraps and locks. After the founding of the Amethyst Knife,  Jutkarr became the syndicate's quartermaster and tactician. He oversees most operations with his cunning intellect and insight.

### Llyvessa

**Llyvessa**, She-Who-Leaps-Across-Moonlight, is the most mysterious member of the Amethyst Knife. The elf's otherworldly appearance shifts between alluring and terrifying. She usually speaks in cryptic Elvish phrases and metaphors that most find impossible to comprehend.

Llyvessa and Harlo met when the guide for Harlo's soon-to-launch expedition mysteriously went missing and she appeared as a last-minute replacement. When the group discovered the crystal dagger, Llyvessa was struck with an overwhelming fear and awe, as though she could see something the others could not. Since then, she has followed the others' orders without question and has made no effort to share her own feelings or ambitions. Her true intentions in the organization remain a mystery.

As a deadly sharpshooter, Llyvessa serves as one of the Amethyst Knife's top assassins, killing with a detached, calculating efficiency.

### Treyvan von Hirnschmann

**Treyvan von Hirnschmann** is the illegitimate half-elf son of Duke Zaltz von Hirnschmann, a minor but influential human noble. To prove himself worthy of a noble title—and of his father's love—Treyvan set out to seek his own fortune. He eventually crossed blades with Victory Graves in a duel, and though Treyvan lost, Vic saw potential in him. Instead of killing the man, she offered him a job on an expedition led by her employer Harlo Honeygrin.

After the expedition, Treyvan initially declined Harlo's offer to join the Amethyst Knife, intending to head home and use his new powers to prove himself to his father. However, Harlo and Victory brought Treyvan evidence of an assassination plot against him—one orchestrated by his father the duke, who hoped to remove Treyvan as a threat to his younger half-sibling's title. Crushed and enraged at the betrayal, Treyvan agreed to join the Amethyst Knife. Seeking revenge, he plans to use the criminal empire to usurp control of his father's domain.

> ##### Humanoid Ability Scores Above 20
>
>The Humanoids in the Amethyst Knife, Soulbinders, and Hallowed Dark have ability scores above 20. Each party has experienced an accident or event that made its members superhuman and bound their fates together.
>

### Victory "Vic" Graves

**Victory** grew up in a rough orphanage that forced her onto the streets as soon as the young human could feed and dress herself. Her childhood instilled what she considers life's most valuable lesson: "The weak think someone will save them. The strong think others will fear them. The clever think everyone beneath them. In the end, it's the ruthless who survive."

Vic learned to fight as soon as she could lift a blade, and she honed her skills in vicious backroom fighting pits and bloody alleyway brawls. She delights in luring foes into oneon-one duels with her, where her sharp reflexes and precise strikes prove deadly. These skills earned her employment as a bodyguard for Harlo when he began his criminal career. Long before the founding of the Amethyst Knife, Vic recognized Harlo's true nature and the commonality in their merciless and selfish values, and she agreed to serve as his second-in-command, a position she has held ever since.

### Magic Items

After returning from their fateful expedition, two members of the Amethyst Knife used the shattered remains of the crystal dagger to forge psionic items for themselves. Harlo Honeygrin carries the *amethyst die*, and Victory wields *mindrazor*.

*Amethyst Die*

*Mindrazor*

### Amethyst Knife Villain Actions

The Amethyst Knife has five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.

- **Action 1: Amethyst Formation.** Treyvan telekinetically moves each willing Amethyst Knife boss who he can see within 60 feet of him up to 30 feet in any direction.
- **Action 2: Leaves Fall on the Moon.** Llyvessa shoots an arrow charged with psionic potential, creating a line of psionic energy that is 5 feet wide and 150 feet long. Each enemy in that area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Action 3: I Planned For This.** Jutkarr issues a coded telepathic instruction and psionically manipulates the space around him. Each Amethyst Knife boss within 60 feet of him can teleport and swap spaces with another willing Amethyst Knife boss in that area (no action required). Each teleporting creature must be able to see the creature they're swapping spaces with.
- **Action 4: Telepathic Tirade.** Victory telepathically taunts one creature she can see within 30 feet of her. Until the end of the target's next turn, they have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and they take 5 (1d10) psychic damage whenever they fail an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.
- **Action 5: Epilogue.** Harlo unleashes a chain of psionic fury. Each enemy within 60 feet of him must make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 28 (8d6) psychic damage and is dazed until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't dazed.

## Soulbinders

*Optimized for Five 13th-Level Characters*

> ##### Content Warning: Possession
>
>The Soulbinders are a once-humanoid collective transformed into sapient, cursed magic items. They possess, transform, and burn the life force of their wielders. If your group would rather avoid the topic of possession, you can instead make the Soulbinders power-hungry warriors whose magic weapons draw on their own life force.
>

The timeless quest for immortality takes countless forms, many of which serve as cautionary tales. In the case of the Soulbinders, their ignorance and greed bound their souls into cursed items that feed off the life force of their wielders.

### Background

Millennia ago, the Soulbinders were a mortal band of explorers. Prince Ellan Farra traveled with his sage advisor, a duo of mercenaries, and a spelunker guide to find their eternal reward—a scroll containing an ancient ritual to grant immortality.

When the party found the ancient text, their ambition blinded them to the ritual's true cost. Each explorer offered a personal treasure, expecting the ritual to consume it. Instead, as the scroll disintegrated, the spell destroyed their bodies and trapped their souls in these objects. Worse, the Soulbinders learned that to fuel their power and truly experience immortal life, they must consume the souls of others, puppeteering the body of each unsuspecting victim until their life force burns out.

### Goals

No record shows how long the Soulbinders have existed, and even they have long forgotten. Unsatisfied with their cursed existence, their hunger remains unsated, for their immortality means nothing without power. The Soulbinders have resolved to achieve godhood, escape their prisons, and elevate their souls to a higher existence.

The Soulbinders believe that in forcing people to worship them as gods, they will in fact become gods. Their main goal is to bring new lands and peoples under their control, then use those resources to acquire even more. The group also searches for new sources of magical power that might hasten their deification.

### Methods

The Soulbinders' unquenchable ambitions and dark magics often require the sacrifice of innocents or other unspeakable acts of violence.

To function, each Soulbinder also needs a body to possess and transform into their old self—and to acquire such a body, a hapless mortal must attune to the cursed item that binds the villain's soul. Once possessed, the victim remains distressingly aware of their former body's actions. The Soulbinders who have obtained bodies aid those who lack one, often by offering unsuspecting adventurers a cursed item as a reward or by planting it where it might be discovered by a chosen traveler. After possessing a user, the victim's soul is consumed over time and the bodies eventually burn out into dust.

***Blackstone Manor.*** The Soulbinders operate from a fortified mansion they call Blackstone Manor, built from the old temple ruins where they first discovered the cursed ritual. A secret passage in the manor's cellar hides the Walk of Bones, an ancient vault and shrine bearing walls inlaid with ash and bone fragments from the Soulbinders' possessed victims.

### Argan Rael

Obsessed with uncovering forbidden magical secrets, **Argan Rael** was shunned by every mage circle he approached for help. Seeking to make fools of his detractors, the tiefling made a desperate case to Prince Ellan Farra, promising to find the secrets of immortality. Taken by the idea of ruling eternally, the prince agreed to support Argan and called for the execution of those who doubted the mage's wisdom.

While knowledge is Argan's passion, his biggest thrill is causing suffering and subjugation. He is loyal to the Soulbinders but takes orders only from Prince Ellan.

The callous wizard prefers to possess other spellcasters, and he resides within the *bracers of the spellbreaker*.

### Kishina Darrowind

When **Kishina Darrowind** was just a young half-elf, her homeland was invaded by the long-lived elf Oramac. She vowed to make the commander pay for his crimes and to outlive him and his kin. Retreating into the wilderness, Kishina struck and killed small bands of Oramac's forces when she could, but as age took its toll on her, her vow for eternal vengeance seemed an angry child's dream. One day, however, Prince Ellan Farra arrived at her door in need of a guide to an ancient ruin.

Now a conqueror herself, Kishina barely thinks about the vengeance she swore or the home she lost. She has become level-headed and dispassionate, willing to justify any action as a means to an end. Godhood is her only passion, though if she could be reminded of how she felt about conquerors in days past, she might hate what she has become.

Kishina is bound to her *pathfinder's boots* and wishes to learn the origin of the ritual that changed her. Was it planar magic? The act of a trickster god? Or something even more unfathomable? If she could find that answer, she's confident she would not only understand that power, but perhaps even learn to wield it.

### Prince Ellan Farra

King Garrow Farra always saw **Prince Ellan**, his eldest child, for what he was: a power-hungry narcissist. When Garrow declared that Ellan's younger siblings would take the crown, the elf prince's narcissism turned to fury. Ellan went to war with his father and siblings—and nearly lost. Before he could finish doing so, however, Ellan learned of Argan's research and the chance at immortality it offered. Ellan abandoned his decimated armies in favor of a new plan: he would become immortal, go into hiding, and outlive his pathetic siblings before emerging to claim the throne forever.

Countless years have passed, and finally, the prince stands ready to seize the throne his father ripped from his hands. But his ambitions have broadened, and now the throne is simply one rung on the ladder to Ellan's godhood.

Though pretentious, callous, and selfish, Ellan is no fool. Both methodical and ruthless, he seeks not only control, but the reverence he believes his due. Ellan is bound to the *crown of majesty*, a magic circlet whose name befits the prince's ego.

### Radlee "The Grim" Thugram

**Radlee Thugram** was one of the countless human subjects who King Garrow conscripted and sent to war against the forces of Prince Ellan. Radlee's unit perished when her ruthless commander set them up as bait in an enemy ambush. Thanks to Radlee's quick thinking, she was the only survivor—and she celebrated her escape by returning to camp and murdering her commander.

After that, Radlee deserted and became a sellsword, quickly earning a frightening reputation. The few survivors of her brutality often simply called her "the Grim." The bloody road of mercenary work led Radlee into partnership with the Scarlet Shadow, a mysterious assassin for hire. Their infamy grew, and one day, the very prince Radlee had been forced to fight came inquiring about a job exploring a remote ruin.

Radlee is cold and matter-of-fact, and despises social platitudes—traits which sometimes put her at odds with the prince. In combat, she is ferocious and unrelenting, protecting her fellow Soulbinders while showing no mercy to her enemies. She is bound to the *visionary's cloak*.

### Scarlet Shadow

**Scarlet Shadow** doesn't share his name or background. Only the dragonborn's closest friend, Radlee Thugram, knows he once belonged to an assassin's guild that bore his name. After a bloody guild war left Scarlet as his organization's only survivor, he took on the guild's name as his own and became an independent contract killer. Eventually, Scarlet joined forces with Radlee and then the rest of the Soulbinders.

Long before Scarlet's curse, he'd already lost most of his humanity. Killing is his only purpose and sadistic pleasure, and he doesn't want to be just any god—he wants to be the god of death. The assassin is bound to the *ring of scarlet shadows*, the last symbol of his old guild.

### Magic Items

Each Soulbinder wears a magic item that houses their eternal soul:

- **Argan Rael**: *bracers of the spellbreaker*
- **Kishina Darrowind**: *pathfinder's boots*
- **Prince Ellan Farra**: *crown of majesty*
- **Radlee "The Grim" Thugram**: * visionary's cloak*
- **Scarlet Shadow**: *ring of scarlet shadows*

If a Soulbinder's body is killed, their magic item can be recovered as treasure. In addition to the properties listed in the magic item descriptions, each item has the following two properties.

***Sentience.*** This magic item is sentient. Its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores match the corresponding persona's stat block.

This magic item has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can speak, read, and understand the languages in its persona's stat block, and it can communicate telepathically with its wearer.

***Curse.*** Once you attune to this item, you can't end your attunement to it unless you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. Seven days after you attune to it, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your Wisdom score is reduced by 1 for as long as you remain attuned to the item. You must repeat this saving throw every 24 hours while you remain attuned to the item.

If you fail this saving throw three times, the magic item possesses your body, and your soul becomes trapped in your body. Your body transforms into the original body of the soul within the magic item, and your statistics change to match the persona in control of your new body. While possessed, your equipment transforms into the equipment used by the possessing persona's stat block. You sense everything your body can sense, but the persona controls your movement, speech, and actions.

If you end your attunement to the magic item, your body returns to its original form, you regain control of your body, and the magic item's soul returns to the magic item. If you die, the magic item's soul returns to the magic item. If your body is possessed for 1d6 + 12 months, your soul is destroyed, your body crumbles to dust, and you die.

> ##### It's Not Me!
>
>Even after a Soulbinder's magic item settles its curse on a new victim, the Soulbinder must wait until the victim's will weakens enough for possession. In the meantime, the Soulbinder builds a friendly relationship with their wearer, striving to convince them that the curse is caused by some other magical force in their life. Since the ill effects of the curse don't manifest for days, it's usually easy to blame the curse on other newly acquired objects or recent events.
>

*Bracers of the Spellbreaker*

*Crown of Majesty*

*Pathfinder's Boots*

*Ring of Scarlet Shadows*

*Visionary's Cloak*

> ##### Soulbinder Items and Stat Blocks
>
>While possessing a body, the Soulbinders wear their respective magic items. However, since each Soulbinder is the item they wear, they can harness the power more effectively than their magic item's normal statistics allow. This makes the Soulbinders powerful villains and simplifies their stat blocks. This means you don't need to track charges or worry about a cloak's hood remaining up during combat.
>

### Soulbinders Villain Actions

The Soulbinders have five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.

- **Action 1: Battle Cry.** Ellan unleashes a cacophonous battle cry. Each enemy within 60 feet of him who can hear him must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the end of their next turn.
- **Action 2: Strategic Positioning.** Radlee and each ally within 60 feet of her who can see or hear her can move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks and take the Hide action.
- **Action 3: Furious Dance.** Kishina unleashes a flurry of spinning attacks against each enemy she can see within 15 feet of her. Each target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and aren't knocked prone.
- **Action 4: Gravity Bomb.** Argan creates an explosion of negative energy centered on a point he can see within 90 feet of him. Each enemy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (6d10) force damage and their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and their speed isn't reduced.
- **Action 5: Shadow Shift.** Scarlet Shadow teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see and makes one Shadow Blade or Razor Garrote attack with advantage. If the attack hits, it is a critical hit.

> ##### Ending the Curse for Good
>
>The characters might wish to permanently uncurse the Soulbinders' magic items to free the souls trapped within the items, or to make the items usable without the threat of possession. At your discretion, the characters can permanently remove the Sentience and Curse properties of each item by finding a second copy of the ritual scroll that trapped the Soulbinders. Performing this ritual near all five items restores each Soulbinder's original body and transfers their souls out of the items back into their bodies. After this occurs, the scroll is reduced to ash and the Sentience and Curse properties of each item are removed.

For every adventurer standing against the oncoming dark, there is a fervid wretch seeking the world's annihilation. Five such zealots serve the gloom dragon **Qazyldrath**. Empowered by drinking the wyrm's blood, the apocalypse cult of the Hallowed Dark now seeks to usher in the Silent Decay's reign of suffocating darkness.

### Background

For many, the Sun Eater was a figure of mere myth and nightmare—but not for Aronar and Athmia Valkys, halfelf twins born under an eclipse. Every birthday brought them whispered promises of power and visions of a dragon swallowing the sun. The twins traveled deep to a forgotten underground temple where they found vials of **Qazyldrath**'s blood. In a profane ritual, the twins each consumed a vial of blood; in return, **Qazyldrath** set one of the wyrm's eyes in each of their heads, granting them supernatural powers. The wyrm also bestowed magical rings on the twins as a mark of favor.

Though Aronar and Athmia were **Qazyldrath**'s first priests of the modern age, the dragon sent similar whispers to three more chosen. Each arrived at the slumbering wyrm's church and gained a dragon's blessings: the tiefling Caithas grew wings, Vivienn's human body was empowered with dragon sinew, and Draven's human blood was replaced with that of a dragon.

Together, they are the Hallowed Dark—and they will expunge every trace of light from this world.

### Goals

The Hallowed Dark ultimately wish to restore **Qazyldrath** to power and end this wretched world. In exchange, the dragon promises dominion over the shadowed world to come.

Methodical, patient, and cruel, the cultists know the path to the lightless world is a long and arduous one—and in the meantime, they relish the suffering they inflict on their path to forever dark. This apocalypse cult commands as much terror as the Sun Eater they seek to reawaken, becoming nightmares for all who cross their path.

### Methods

**Qazyldrath** communicates intermittently with the Hallowed Dark through visions, dreams, and impressions, drawing their priests to dark corners of the world. In these remote places, the cult enacts a series of costly and prolonged rituals to reawaken the Silent Decay. The rituals require rare, void-touched components: fallen stars and meteorites, the hearts or minds of eldritch entities, deep-mined iron wielded by those who travel between planes, and more.

Meanwhile, the cult spreads darkness and fear. They believe terror crushes hope, and without hope, people  will buckle when the end approaches. The Hallowed Dark has committed many atrocities—terrorist attacks on temples and government buildings, destruction of systems that provide societal structure and safety, wanton slaughter, and torture of those they bother to leave alive. If the whimpering mortals they spare go wailing to others about **Qazyldrath**'s return—well, all the better.

### Aronar Valkys

**Aronar Valkys** is a prodigy spellcaster, born under an eclipse and rumored to have thieved magic from the gods themselves in the night. The half-elf keeps no holy symbol and worships at no temple, yet he commanded divine magic long before he supped on **Qazyldrath**'s blood. Aronar scorns spellcasters who chain themselves to the gods, claiming that the secrets of heaven await anyone cunning enough to claim them.

He proudly wields the right eye of **Qazyldrath**, which grants the gift of clarity of mind and the wisdom of dragons. It was **Qazyldrath**'s promises of knowledge that drew Aronar to follow them—he saw visions of himself and Athmia shaping the new world with magic no mortal possessed, becoming figures of unimaginable nightmare.

Aronar's calm demeanor belies his arrogance and narcissism. He longs for nothing more than unchecked dominion in the new world. Cunning and careful, the halfelf sees all with his draconic eye and bides his time.

### Athmia Valkys

While Aronar lusts after the mastery of magic, **Athmia** needs no grand display to kill, just a single touch on her victim's mind. From childhood, she was a silent killer, rending the minds of small animals to sharpen her cognitive blades. Her arts of mental assassination allow her to tear down mental barriers and gouge out secrets without lifting a hand, leaving behind corpses with bleeding ears.

Her discretion and lethality earned her **Qazyldrath**'s left eye, a gift of shrewdness and stealth. In her visions, she saw her dark gifts praised, her ascendancy assured—and power, so much power for her insatiable mind.

Athmia allows Aronar to act as the cult's outward-facing "leader," but they work as equals—Aronar the politicking manipulator, Athmia the blade in the dark. During the rare times she speaks, she shows herself to be merciless, cold, and wholly devoted to the end of the world.

### Caithas

Born from a deal with a devil, **Caithas**'s mother hid him from the militantly devout people of his small hometown. The tiefling lived under the floors of his mother's house, nurturing his creativity and filling those dark spaces with drawings of what he imagined the world looked like.

Then, at the age of eleven, he was discovered. The prejudiced people of the town chased Caithas into the wilds, where he nearly starved before learning to forage. During those dark months, **Qazyldrath** spoke to him in dreams. The gloom dragon taught him not only to hunt and survive, but to thrive. As Caithas grew, he became a keen hunter, and the mysterious dragon in his dreams was his sole friend.

Caithas was the first cultist Aronar and Athmia welcomed into the fold. While Caithas lacks the depth of the others' cruelty and ambitions, **Qazyldrath** has spent a lifetime filling his head with dreams of a beautiful, shadowed world, and his loyalty to the dragon runs deep. Caithas often falls into wry humor that turns to mockery, a reflection of his deep distrust of mortalkind. He watches his back, even around the other cultists, and trusts only **Qazyldrath** with his safety.

### Draven Malas

Had vengeance not consumed him so deeply, **Draven Malas** would've been heralded as a paragon. A prominent government figure and a sorcerer of some renown, he dabbled in blood magic, certain he would never be drawn into its tempting darkness. But when his son died in a bandit attack, Draven snapped. He hunted down the bandits and the guards who failed to protect his boy, cursing their blood and boiling each offender from the inside. He was branded a murderer and fled.

Lost in grief, Draven was perfectly vulnerable when **Qazyldrath** gave him dreams—visions of a world where no evils would go unpunished, where Draven's fury was righteous and right. These visions guided him to the cult.

**Qazyldrath** gave Draven the weightiest blessing of all, the blessing of blood. After nearly dying during his transformation, he revived to find the blood of dragons empowering his body. Draven is reckless and driven by rage, pushing himself to his limits in combat. He tears down his enemies' hopes and defenses, leaving them vulnerable and afraid before they die.

### Vivienn Dirroze

Raised by frivolous nobles in a cutthroat court, **Vivienn Dirroze** decided young that her ambitions pointed higher. Her peers were content to vie for political power and assassinate rivals, but Vivienn refused to rest until she beheaded the source of true power—the gods themselves.

Filled with unholy ardor, the young human searched the world for secrets of god-killing. Finding traces of **Qazyldrath**, she made her way to the forgotten temple, where she offered her greataxe to the Hallowed Dark in exchange for the privilege of slaughtering the gods during the death of the world. **Qazyldrath** accepted her terms—and it was only then that Vivienn first heard the dragon's whispers.

Vivienn doesn't want power, she wants conquest. She yearns to meet her match and surpass it. **Qazyldrath**'s gifts allow the warrior to unleash a draconic bloodfrenzy. She gleefully toes the line between discipline and wildness, holiness and blasphemy, cutting down any who stand between her and the darkness.

### Magic Items

**Qazyldrath** entrusted Aronar and Athmia with two rings: Aronar with the *Sun Eater's soul* and Athmia with the *Sun Eater's mind*.

*Sun Eater's Soul*

*Sun Eater's Mind*

### Hallowed Dark Villain Actions

The Hallowed Dark has five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.

- **Action 1: Shadow Blessing.** Aronar chooses up to three members of the Hallowed Dark he can see within 120 feet of him. Each target can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space they can see, and until the end of each target's next turn, they are covered in shadowy armor that grants them resistance to all damage and a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- **Action 2: Dual Blades.** Athmia moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks and makes two melee attacks.
- **Action 3: Hunter of Mortals.** Caithas imbues several arrows with draconic power. He can make one Scaled Longbow attack against each enemy within 600 feet of him. If any of these attacks reduces a target to 0 hit points, they die.
- **Action 4: Blood Drain.** Draven steals the vitality of one enemy he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 27 (5d10) necrotic damage and is dazed until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't dazed. Draven then restores a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage dealt, divided however he chooses between himself and any member of the Hallowed Dark he can see within 60 feet of him.
- **Action 5: Wrath of the Godslayer.** Vivienn hurls her axe in a wrathful circle then compels it back into her hand. Each enemy within 30 feet of her must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 34 (4d12 + 8) slashing damage and be knocked prone.
