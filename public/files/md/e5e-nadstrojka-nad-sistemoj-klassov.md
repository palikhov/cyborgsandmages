В систему классов, архетипов и альтернативных классовых способностей можно также добавить дополнительные элементы, которые будут схожи для всех:

\- исследовательские приемы (exploration knacks), к которым класс получает доступ на 1-2 уровне

\- классовые знания (class lore), к которым класс получает доступ на 6-8 уровне

\- особенность репутации (reputation benefit), к которым класс получает доступ на 9-12 уровнях.

Надо признать что эту систему придумали во время разработки А5Е – но не смогли красиво реализовать.

Я попробую. Хоть и буду для начала рассматривать 6 базовых классов:

- Боец
- Клерик
- Волшебник
- Бард
- Рейнджер
- Плут
- Паладин

# Исследовательские приемы

\- Уникальный (хоть и пересекающийся) набор приемов для каждого из классов.

\- Получение дополнительных при переходе на второй и третий этапы игры

### Secrets of Nature

When you gain access to a new secret of nature, choose one of the following.

### Aerial Surveyor

You are at home soaring at dizzying heights and peering towards the horizon. You can familiarize        \\)

yourself with a 5-mile radius area around you by spending a minute studying your surroundings while flying or at great heights.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you obtain a medicinal or rare herb using an herbalism kit, you gain twice as many medicinals or rare herbs.

### Marshland Guide

Bogs and swamps are unpleasant to most but are filled with natural beauty to you. Moving through swamps, bogs, or muddy difficult terrain costs you no extra movement and you cannot become naturally lost while traveling through marshlands. In addition, you ignore the effects of roughing it imposed by resting in wet or swampy environments.

In addition, you add your proficiency bonus to the number of minutes you can hold your breath before suffocating, and can spend 1 exertion to hold your breath for an additional minutes equal to your proficiency bonus.

A steady stance and careful footwork is instinctive to you. You have advantage on any check or saving throw to avoid falling prone or handle difficult ground (such as against a grease spell or slippery ice). You are never prone after taking fall damage, and when calculating fall damage you treat the fall distance as if it were shorter by a number of feet equal to your proficiency bonus x 10.

### Weather Beaten

Exposed to all kinds of weather over your life, you are inured to all but the most deadly effects. You gain advantage on saving throws against cold and hot weather, as well as any adverse effects from wind or precipitation.

The creature makes an Insight check opposed by your Persuasion check, becoming inspired by you on a failure. Indifferent creatures you inspire in this way become friendly towards you and your allies, and friendly creatures you inspire in this way will consider you an ally and may provide you with local information that would otherwise remain secret. Creatures will remain inspired by you indefinitely unless you do something that would make them hostile or lose confidence in you, such as lying, stealing, or causing them or their allies harm, or being proven cowardly or untrustworthy in any way.
