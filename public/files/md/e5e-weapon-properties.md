Bulky armor has a Strength score requirement of 9 or more. If your Strength score is less than the requirement, your are considered to carry Medium Load (see pg. \[60\](#p60)) until you doff the armor. Bulky armor imposes disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to swim, climb, run, and similar activities. These penalties can be avoided if your Strength score is at least 2 points higher than the armor's Strength requirement. Bulky armor impedes your initiative in combat. When you roll for Initiative, subtract 2 for each Bulky armor component you wear. Bulky armor also impedes your movement when standing from Prone. Add +1 to the Standing from Prone DC for each Bulky armor component you wear.

**Concealable.** When you attempt to hide a concealable weapon on your person, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to do so.

**Entrapping.** When you want to catch and restrain a weapon in combat, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, an entrapment attempt with this weapon. If you have multiple attacks as part of the Attack action, this replaces one of them. The target of your entrapment must be within the reach of your weapon and wielding a melee or ranged weapon.

If you win, the target can't make attacks with the entrapped weapon until the entrapment ends. You can't move out of your weapon's range, make an attack with the entrapping weapon, or drop your own weapon without releasing the entrapped weapon, which you can do at any time.
