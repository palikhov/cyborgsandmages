## Школы магии

Spellcasters categorize their spells into schools. Each spell listed belongs to one of the following schools. All magic-user cantrips, as well as the Enchant an Item and Permanency spells belong to more than one school, allowing them all to be cast by specialist magic-users:

1\. Abjuration: Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.

2\. Alteration/Transmutation: Alteration spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at your command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. Alteration spells are commonly referred to as transmutation spells due to their effects.

3\. Conjuration/Summoning: Conjuration/Summoning spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.

4\. Divination: Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of long-forgotten secrets, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.

5\. Enchantment/Charm: Enchantment/Charm spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.

6\. Invocation/Evocation: Invocation/Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect, such as calling up blasts of fire, walls of ice, or fields of force magic.

7\. Illusion/Phantasm: Illusion/Phantasm spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature. Some Illusion spells draw energy from the Demiplane of Shadow in order to create quasi-real objects and effects.

A rule of illusions is that an illusion is only as good as the caster who created it. They draw from personal experience, so a caster cannot create a truly believable illusion unless he is intimately familiar with whatever he is attempting to create.

8\. Necromancy: Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can restore life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or bring the dead back to life.

Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells, such as Animate Dead, is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.

Universal: Consider universal magic to be Sorcery 101; without the basic spells in this school, magic-users are incapable of continuing their studies in the other schools of magic. Therefore, all magic­users have access to the spells in this school, regardless of specialization.

## Измененная устойчивость к волшебству

Оригинальное свойство «Устойчивость к волшебству» (Magic Resistance) давало существу преимущество на спасброски против эффектов заклинаний.

Новое свойство «Сопротивление волшебству» \[Spell Resistance\] работает иначе – приближенно к правилам старых редакций и представляет собой Класс Сложности проверки заклинательной характеристики, которую должен успешно превозмочь заклинатель, чтобы его заклинание вообще оказало влияние на цель. При этом Сопротивление волшебству распространяется и на положительные эффекты заклинаний.

Сопротивление волшебству определяется как 15+2\*Бонус владения существа.

Так, у демона с 17 уровнем опасности и бонусом владения +6 будет Сопротивление волшебству 27.

Бонус проверки заклинателя для определения превозмогания устойчивости к волшебству определяется как: бонус владения заклинателя + модификатор его заклинательной характеристики + круг сотворенного заклинания (для заговоров – 0) + прочие модификаторы.

Прочие модификаторы этой проверки возникают если заклинатель обладает волшебными предметами или свойствами, которые увеличивают Класс Сложности сотворяемых им заклинаний.

Например, у волшебника 15 уровня с 22 интеллектом при сотворении Изгнания (заклинание 4-го круга) с надетой робой архимага (которая увеличивает КС заклинаний на 2) бонус к проверке будет составлять: 5 (бонус владения) + 2 (роба архимага) + 6 (модификатор интеллекта) + 4 (уровень заклинания) = +17.

## Измененные заклинания

Each creature along any of its lengths becomes a target of the spell, though a creature cannot be targeted by the same lightning bolt more than once.

**Magic Weapon** can affect magical weapons as well as nonmagical weapons. A magical weapon only gains the bonus to attack and damage rolls if it does not already have such a bonus. You can touch a creature’s natural weapons (such as its claws or teeth) to grant this benefit to that natural weapon, or you can touch a humanoid’s arms or legs to grant this benefit to the creature’s unarmed strikes.

If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its tempoAlistar hit points and reverts to its normal form.”
