### Random Map Generators (Cave, Dungeon, Wilderness)

I did a post about these bottom three before: [Random Wilderness, Dungeon and Cave Map Generator](https://d20.pub/resources/random-wilderness-dungeon-and-cave-map-generator/)

#### DUNGEON GENERATORS

[Random Dungeon Map Creator](http://www.gozzys.com/dungeon-maps): Choose either a Wandering Line Style Dungeon Map or a Random Room Style Dungeon Map. Both allow you to choose Map Size, Room Density, and Background. Wandering Line Style lets you set a maximum room size width and height, change the tile set, and adjust the Randomness from None, Some to Lots. Random Room Style lets you change the Room Density from Lowest to Highest, and choose either Classic or Ruins Room Set. This Creator LACKS a monster/encounter/traps generator component the Donjon Dungeon Generators below have. [Donjon Random Dungeon Generators](http://donjon.bin.sh/d20/dungeon/index.cgi): There are too many settings you can choose from to list here. The BEST thing about these generators is all BUT the [Fantasy Random Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/dungeon/) POPULATE the Dungeon Randomly! It’s a really impressive process of random monsters, wandering monsters, traps, room descriptions and more. If you want a random dungeon to populate yourself then use the Donjon Fantasy one or the Gozzy’s one above. To have a random dungeon completely ready to go with encounters and everything just choose the one that goes with your system below:

- [Fantasy Random Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/dungeon/) (generic dungeon map with no monsters or encounters)
- [AD&D 2nd Ed. Random Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/adnd/dungeon/) (includes monsters & encounters)
- [D20 D&D 3.0/3.5 Random Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/d20/dungeon/) (includes monsters & encounters)
- [Microlite20 M20 Random Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/m20/dungeon/) (includes monsters & encounters)
- [Pathfinder Random Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/pathfinder/dungeon/) (includes monsters & encounters)
- [D&D 4th Ed. (4E) Random Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/4e/dungeon/) (includes monsters & encounters)
- [D&D 5th Ed. (5E) Random Dungeon Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/5e/dungeon/) (includes monsters & encounters)

#### CAVE GENERATORS

[Curufea’s Random Cave map generator](http://www.curufea.com/games/roguelike/map.php): This might be my new favorite cave generator. The maps looks really good, colored, with variations and they even include extra items like furnishings, lighting, vegetation, water, ladders, and different elevations. [Random Cave Map Creator](http://www.gozzys.com/cave-maps): My favorite Cave, Cavern, Underground Map Generator. Donjon’s below is good too. [Donjon Random Cavern Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/dungeon/cavern.cgi): I still like the Gozzy’s Cave Map Generator above, but this one by Donjon is really cool too. One of the best features is the “Player Map” option. By default this Cavern/Cave Map Generator places numbers in sections for the DM to track encounters, the Player Map prints without these. Options are: Map Style, Grid (None, Square, Hex, VerHex) Cave/Cavern Size (Fine to Colossal, and there’s a Custom Size option to type in as many Rows & Columns you want). They call it Peripheral Egress, but this means how many entrances or exits you want for the cave complex. [Random Wilderness Map Creator](http://www.gozzys.com/wilderness-maps): [http://www.gozzys.com/wilderness-maps](http://www.gozzys.com/wilderness-maps)

### NPC Generators

[Donjon D20 D&D 3.0/3.5 Random NPC Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/d20/random/#type=npc): Choose Gender, Race, Class and Culture, this generator creates 10 NPCs with Name, Gender, Race, Class (Fighter, Monk, Wizard, etc…), their Alignment, Base Stats (Str, Dex, …) a brief physical description and even a sentence of their motivation.

- [Donjon D20 D&D 3.0/3.5 Random NPC Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/d20/random/#type=npc)
- [Pathfinder Random NPC Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/pathfinder/random/)
- [D&D 4th Edition (4E) Random NPC Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/4e/random/#type=npc)
- [D&D 5th Edition (5E) Random NPC Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/5e/random/#type=npc)
- [Donjon Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D / 2nd Ed.) NPC Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/adnd/random/#type=npc): Choose Any Gender, Any Race, Any Class and a Culture then generate 10 NPCs to use in your 2nd Edition D&D Game.
- [Microlite20 M20 Random NPC Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/m20/random/#type=npc)
- [Science Fiction Random NPC Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/scifi/random/#type=space_npc)

[NPC Birthing Sacs](https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/generators/npc-birthing-sacs/): This is a super weird name, but it’s a really useful generator for creating Non-Player Character with Backgrounds, Names, Motivations, Quirks, Race, Gender, Demeanour, Appearance and more. [Rabble Generator](https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/generators/rabble-rouser/): Again, a weird name, but incredibly useful for rolling up many NPCs at once. Just type the number of NPCs you want to generate and it spits out names, brief descriptions, appearance and hit points. This is great for populating a business, tavern, inn, or anywhere you need quick access to several random people.

[Choose Your Own Generator](https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/generators/choose-your-own-generator/): I have no idea what you would use this for, but I didn’t want to omit it unless it was helpful for someone. The page provides you with blank tables you can fill with any entries, turning them into a personal random generator. Results are generated right on the page. You can save the generator as a link for random result each time you click it. All the information that makes up the generator is contained within the link, so it can be used even when you’re offline provided you can access your bookmarks, works on phones and tablets, and can be embedded into your blog posts. [Community List of Random Generators created using the Choose your Own Generator](https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/generators/the-seventh-order-of-the-random-generator/)
