Adverse weather and gnawing hunger can claim just as many lives as monsters and traps. The following items are necessities when facing inhospitable environments and harsh journeys:

**Bedroll.** This essential commodity provides insulation and comfortable sleep on rocky, wet, or uneven terrain.

**Blanket.** Provides warmth while resting in cold environments.

**Climbing Gear.** A set of climbing gear includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climbing gear as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the anchor point, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

**Cold Weather Gear.** Cold weather gear includes special boots, gloves, warm padding, and face protection. This gear can be worn over or under any armor and takes 5 minutes to don or remove. While wearing cold weather gear you automatically succeed on saving throws against effects caused by an environment of extreme cold, but have disadvantage on saving throws against effects from environments of extreme heat and spells or effects that deal fire damage. This gear can also be worn to provide warmth while resting in cold environments.

**Compass.** This device has a free-turning needle that always points towards the magnetic north.

**Fishing Trap.** Whenever you retrieve this arrangement of netting, wires, and weights from a body of water with aquatic life, roll a d20 and add a bonus equal to the number of hours the trap has been set. On a 21 or higher the trap has captured fish or other aquatic animals totaling 1d4 Supply.

**Hunting Snare.** This simple arrangement of stakes, wires, and ropes can be set for catching small game in woodlands, forests, or other hunting grounds. Whenever you retrieve the snare, roll a d20 and add a bonus equal to the number of hours the snare has been set. On a 21 or higher the snare has captured and killed a Tiny game animal with 1d4 Supply.

**Hunting Trap.** Once you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or it takes 2d4 piercing damage and stops moving. On a failed save, until the creature breaks free of the trap its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1d4 piercing damage to the trapped creature. Hunting traps of higher quality are more complex and effective, increasing the DC of each saving throw and ability check (by 2 for fine hunting traps, or by 4 for masterwork hunting traps).

**Map.** When using a map, you may travel at a fast pace without taking a penalty to your passive Perception while within the area it depicts. If you also use a compass in conjunction with a map, you gain an expertise die on checks made to avoid becoming lost.

Local: This map depicts an area that is well known to its makers and shows the full details as well as routes within the realm, including the names of hamlets, villages, and towns.

Distant: This map depicts a region far-flung from those that made it, and it only shows the major geographical features and best known routes within the realm.

Frontier: This map depicts an area only recently explored by those that made it and the information is often incorrect or incom¬plete. When consulting this map, the Narrator rolls a secret d20. On a result of 5 or less, the outdated or false information wastes travel time turning around and doubling back and the party only progresses half as much distance towards their destination.

**Marshland Gear.** Marshland gear includes special boots, gloves, and clothes designed to repel moisture and muck. This gear can be worn over light armor and takes 5 minutes to don or remove. While you are wearing marshland gear, you can move at a normal pace through nonmag- ical swamps and marshes, but you have disad¬vantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws made on dry or rocky terrain.

**Mosquito Netting.** This thin mesh cloth provides protection from small insects while sleeping in jungles, swamps, or similar envi¬ronments.

**Rations.** Rations can vary wildly depending on the culture, but they usually consist of a day’s worth of water and dry foods suitable for extended travel like jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, or nuts.

**Tent.** These stitched together canvases, hides, or tarps provide protection from the elements so long as there is a flat space for them to be deployed.

One Person: Suitable for a Medium-sized creature. Occupies a 5-foot by 10-foot space when set up.

Two Person: Suitable for up to 2 Medi¬um-sized creatures. Occupies a 10-foot by 10-foot space when set up.

Communal: Suitable for up to 6 Medi¬um-sized creatures. Occupies a 15-foot by 15-foot space when set up.

**Torch.** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. When you use a burning torch as a club to make a melee attack, it deals an extra 1 fire damage on a hit.

**Torch (Alchemical).** The rough, sticky tar at the end of this torch burns through even the most adverse conditions. An alchemical torch burns for 1 hour even in heavy rains, strong winds, and underwater (albeit poorly when submerged, shedding only dim light in a 5-foot radius). Dimmer than a normal torch, it sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
