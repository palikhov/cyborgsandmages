The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d12 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d12).

### Courage

A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the spell ends, the creature has advantage on saving throws against fear effects and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
