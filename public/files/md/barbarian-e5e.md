# PRIMAL PATHS

## PATH OF THE SHAMAN

In most tribal cultures, the separation between the spiritual and physical worlds necessitates the existence of shamans; intermediaries that bridge the two worlds and keep them in balance. Problems in one world can often be traced to sources in the other, and it is the responsibility of a shaman to restore order in both worlds by resolving such conflicts.

Many tribal shamans are severe, humourless sorts, acutely aware of the great responsibility which they bear. They have been trained to safeguard the tribe, both its morals and its actual safety, and rarely take this responsibility lightly. The role of the shamans demands that they must speak out boldly for what is right, and yet when dealing with important members of the tribe they must learn tact and control. Committed to serving ancient spirits and maintaining tribal traditions, they are usually extremely conservative, fiercely resisting any sort of religious or social change.

Most try to make themselves paragons of moral respectability, strictly adhering to the standards that the spirits demand the tribe follows. Few are so strong willed that they have no human failings, but their tribes usually expect them to live exemplary lives and may cease to respect them if they do not.

Shamans have the unique ability to enter into a Trance that puts them in direct communion with the spirit world. While most “civilized’ religions ascribe a certain unique quality to the souls of sapient creatures, many tribal societies rejects any such clear-cut distinction. A river has just as much of a soul as a human does, and animistic traditions may refer to animals and objects as “people” in the same sense that the word would be applied to humans, olve, or dwur. Everything on Oerth has a spirit of its own, with the same capacity for reason, emotion, and desire. There is nothing unique about the spirit belonging to a sapient creature—the fundamental nature of an entity’s spirit is not defined by the entity’s intelligence, mobility, or ability to communicate.

While in the spirit world, a shaman perceives all of the spirits around her— animistic spirits, and spirits of the dead, spirits of the place—that can commune with a shaman. However, not all spirits will necessarily deign to speak with her: while animistic spirits will almost never refuse to commune, spirits of the dead may have reasons to deny a shaman audience, and spirits of places might be too proud to commune with a wandering shaman.

For the most part, communion between spirits and shamans is intended simply to reinforce the relationship between a shaman and the spirits, as well as to inform the spirits of the presence of a shaman in their midst. While spirits are aware of events in their immediate surroundings, they rarely have any knowledge of events that are not directly related to them. While a spirit of a location will know much of what has occurred within its territory, it may be unwilling to divulge details out of proud stoicism or out of loyalty to its more permanent residents.

Unlike your more wild brethren, you don’t rage per se. Instead you enter a Trance that has all the same mechanical effects of your class’ rage feature but instead of entering a violent blood-lust, you remain serene and oddly detached from the world as you gaze into the spirit world seeking the guidance of the totem spirits there. When in a trance, you appear to almost be an automaton, your eyes may roll back in your head or you may appear as though you are a puppet on strings as your actions are directed by the totemic spirits that guide you.

Shamans are found across the length and breadth of Oerik wherever tribal societies dominate. The Flan shamans of the Rover of the Barrens are greatly feared by their Wegwiur (Wolf Nomad) rivals. The shaman of the devolved Suel Amedi people ingest a hallucinogenic concoction to aid them in communing with the spirit world while those of the Paynims often enter their trances through drumming and dance. The Shaman of the Korobokkuru people of western Oerik inhale vapours of a special incense to achieve their trance state.

### MEDICINE MAN

When you select this Path at 3rd level you gain proficiency in the Herbalist Kit and the Healer’s Kit.

### SPELLCASTING

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast druid spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the druid spell list. Unlike the arcane formulas of wizards and sorcerers or the divine prayers of clerics, the verbal components of your spells take the form of shouts, chants and primal screams.

### CANTRIPS

You learn three cantrips: druidcraft and two other cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn another druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

### SPELL SLOTS

The Shaman Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

### SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER

You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the conjuration, divination, or evocation or spells on the druid spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Shaman Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the druid spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature and the spirit world. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### SHAMANIC RITUALS

At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the Detect Poison and Disease and Locate Animals or Plants spells, but only as rituals, as described in the Spellcasting section. Casting them in this way does not require a spell slot.

### TOTEMIC GUIDANCE

Starting at 6th level, your totem guides enable you to cast spells while in a Trance (i.e. rage) but you suffer disadvantage on rolls to maintain concentration if the spell requires it. Your Trance duration is the same as the normal rage class feature and you do not leave your Trance if you attack, take damage, or cast a spell of 1st level or higher during your turn. When you cast a spell that deals damage while in this Trance (i.e. you are raging) you can add your Rage Damage to that damage.

### SPIRIT MEDICINE

At 10th level, as a bonus action you can choose to make a spell or cantrip more effective by ingesting or inhaling certain medicinal herbs, fungi or similar substances. You can activate the feature with the same bonus action used to activate your Trance and you receive advantage on your spell attack or cause the target to suffer disadvantage on their saving throws against your spell. Targets affected by an area effect spell all receive disadvantage to their saving throws.

This effect lasts for one minute after which you suffer one level of exhaustion and you regain the ability to use this feature again after a long rest.

### VISION QUEST

Beginning at 14th level you have learned esoteric means of communing with your totemic spirits to gain insight into things that would normally be a unknown to you. You can cast the Commune or Scrying spell as a ritual. This spell does not count against your prepared spells, does not require a spell slot and does not require material components. You can do this once and regain the ability to do so on a long rest.

## PATH OF THE T OTEM WARRIOR

## REAVER

Piracy is a grave threat in the Known World. Whether privateers sponsored in secret by various nations or criminals engaging in high seas robbery, anyone setting foot on a ship runs the risk of encountering pirates. The most feared pirates on the sea are the reavers, drug- fueled madmen who exist only to slaughter.

No one nation can lay claim to reavers, anyone with a death wish that can bury an ax into an enemy sailor can be a reaver. To help them with their slaughter, they imbibe a large number of narcotics that give them almost supernatural abilities. The drugs they take before battle inflict a terrible toll on their bodies, many of them have survived a fierce battle only to drop dead from the effects of the toxic drugs that gave them their prowess in combat.

While most reavers are human, anyone desperate enough to risk their health for any advantage in combat is capable of becoming one. Elf and dwarf reavers are rare but not unheard of, even the hin pirates from the Five Shires have been known to have one or two reavers in their crews. Reavers can be found off the coasts of lerendi and Minrothad, even as far cast as Alphatia or up the coast of the Northern Reaches. A ship known to carry reavers will often have targeted ships strike their colors rather than face the horrors of the reavers.

Despite their undeniable effectiveness in combat, most ships fear reavers among their crew.

Reavers have but one purpose, to kill who they are

### AMOK

Starting at 3rd level, when you enter a rage, you can choose to run amok. To run amok, you take a single dose of the following drugs and apply the effects for the duration of the rage.

While you are running amok after the turn you started your rage, you take 1d4 damage per dose taken, ignoring all resistances, immunities, and temporary hit points. You have to spend 10 GP per week to restock your stash of drugs.

Drugs:

**Black Fury:** Add your Proficiency Bonus when rolling for damage from melee attacks.

**Coward's Bane:** At the start of each round, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier plus your proficiency bonus. Remember that temporary hit points do not stack.

**Gorgon Tears:** You gain resistance to all forms of damage except psychic.

**Quickling Essence: You** may use your bonus action to take another attack.

**Tempus Fugitive:** You have advantage on all saving throws.

### BOARDING Party
