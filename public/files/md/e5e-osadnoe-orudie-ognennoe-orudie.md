**_Flame Cannon._** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (5d6) fire damage, and the target catches fire. While on fire, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by immersing itself in water or by using an action to make a successful DC 12 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

_A flame cannon is a bulky mechanical contraption that hurls casks of alchemist's fire that explode on impact. Before one of these weapons can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. Each flame cannon has three casks of improved alchemist's fire resting next to it._
