_Cloaked in Art, we strode across Faerun like giants, our wizardry clawing at Mystryl's Weave and propelling us to ever-greater heights of spellhurling. The Archwizards of Netheril they called us, and all trembled under our regard or hid from it like the smallest of scurrying ants. Yet, when the hubris ofKarsus doomed our greatest bindings, and the vaunted enclaves dropped from the heavens like so many fleeting raindrops, we took stock of what magic remained to us and hoarded it like the most avaricious of dragons. Of all the secrets of magecraft that we had commanded the only powerful remnant was our mastery of mantles, and we pledged to safeguard this legacy till the day when mighty Netheril would rise to greatness once again._

_Thausgras of Orolin, Sage of the Ancients Musings on the Fall of Netheril_

_Year of the Ruling Sceptre (-278 DR)_

Select archmages and schools of magic retain mastery over some Netherese magical traditions from the ancient past of the Realms, and they are prepared to share this knowledge with novice wizards and teach it to them. The most common arcane tradition is that of the arcanists of Low Netheril They eschewed the "fast and easy" Art offered by loulaum's mythallar magic and continued to study and build on the spellcasting teachings of the elves who had taught the legendary first arcanist Therion of Gers, thousands of years prior. The arcanist magical tradition lives on in the Realms and is eagerly studied by those with a taste for ancient magics.

## SCHOOL OF THE ARCANIST

The School of the Arcanist teaches a wizard the spellcasting traditions of the wizards of Low Netheril This arcane tradition allows a wizard to draw on the Weave to create a personal aura around them that protects and enhances their ability to wield magic. Arcanists are devoted to the use of magic of any kind and gloiy in the sheer exhilaration of shaping the Weave and gaining greater mastery over the Art.

## Thaelkiira

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock or wizard)_

This gem can be of any hue and faceted or cabochon cut, although diamonds are typically the gem of first-choice for creators of such items. Some _thaelkiira_ are engraved with the personal sigil of the wizard or the symbol of the elven noble house that created them.

A _thaelkiira_ stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The gem can store total spell levels equal to 5 plus the Intelligence modifier of the creature attuned to it. Only the creature attuned to it can cast a spell into the _thaelkiira_ by touching the gem as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the _thaelkiira._ The creature attuned to the gem always knows how many spell levels the _thaelkiira_ contains and what spells it holds. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While in physical contact with the _thaelkiira,_ you can cast any spell stored in it as a bonus action. Any spell cast from the gem is no longer stored in it, freeing up space which can be filled at any time by the creature attuned to it.

If another creature attunes to a particular _thaelkiira,_ all prior spells stored in that gem are immediately lost.



## Mantle

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust and powdered dragon scales of any type worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 day

You bring into being an aura called a mantle, visible only as a momentary shimmering in the air, that surrounds you for the spell's duration. You choose a cantrip that you can cast and that has a casting time of 1 action. You cast that cantrip— called a stored spell—as part of casting _mantle,_ but the stored spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it remains quiescent in the mantle and can be cast as a bonus action at a later time in the _mantle_ spell's duration. If you use a bonus action to cast a stored spell the power of the mantle allows you to cast another spell with a casting time of 1 action during the same turn, bypassing the prohibition in the PHB (p.202>

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can add a spell of 1st level that you can cast and has a casting time of 1 action, into your mantle, in addition to a cantrip. If you cast a 1st level spell as part of casting _mantle,_ you expend spell slots for both. Both the cantrip and the 1st level stored spell can be cast as a bonus action at any time time in the _mantle_ spell's duration. Only a single stored spell can be cast on your turn using a bonus action. You are able to use your action to cast another spell with a casting time of 1 action during the same turn due to your mantle, bypassing the prohibition in the PHB (p.202).

If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can add a spell of 2nd level into your mantle that you can cast and has a casting time of 1 action, in addition to a cantrip and a 1st level spell If you cast a 2nd level spell as part of casting _mantle,_ you expend spell slots for both this spell and the 1st level spell This 2nd level stored spell can also be cast as a bonus action at any time in the _mantle_ spell's duration. Only a single stored spell can be cast on your turn using a bonus action. If you use a bonus action to cast a stored spell the power of the mantle allows you to cast another spell with a casting time of 1 action during the same turn, bypassing the prohibition in the PHB (p.202).

If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level you can add a spell of 3rd level into your mantle that you can cast and has a casting time of 1 action, in addition to a cantrip, a 1st level spell and a 2nd level spell You expend spell slots for both this spell and all stored spells as part of casting _mantle._ This 3rd level stored spell can also be cast as a bonus action at any time in the _mantle_ spell's duration. Only a single stored spell can be cast on your turn using a bonus action.
