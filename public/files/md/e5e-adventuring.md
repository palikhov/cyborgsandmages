## ABILITY CHECKS

The following describes changes and adjudication to general ability check rules.

### FEATS OF STRENGTH

The section of the Player's Handbook on Lifting and Carrying details only what players can accomplish without much effort.

A Strength check, usually without a skill, can be made to push beyond these limits. A DC 15 check allows a character to push, drag, or lift 50% more than their normal given weights, or twice as much with a DC 20 check. A DC 25 check should allow a character to push, drag, or lift at least three times as much!

Of course, keeping track of these amounts can be a hassle. The DM will likely simply set a DC they feel is appropriate to the situation.

### KNOWLEDGE CHECKS

During the course of an adventure, players may encounter things that their characters may know about, but which they do not. Doing this makes heavy use of Intelligence¬based skills. The DM decides which skill applies, if any, with suggestions given on the Monster Knowledge Skills table.

Usually these checks are made without much trouble. When a player wants to know about a creature during combat, however, combat can be slowed down. To make a check to recall information about a creature, an object, or anything else, a character must use their action or reaction to do so.

A check to identify a creature and its general strengths has a DC of 10 + half the creature's CR. This increases by 5 if the creature is not from the Material Plane. Succeeding by 5 or more also recalls some or all of the creature's specific abilities and weaknesses.

### CHARISMA CHECKS

Charisma checks and their corresponding skills can be a point of contention. Firstly, they are not a replacement for roleplaying—trying to get one's point across and interacting with an NPC should be a precursor to any Charisma check in situations that are not simply handwaved during shopping, downtime, or other bookkeeping tasks.

Charisma checks are often better treated as a way to see how a situation pans out, in a more meta sense. A high Charisma (Persuasion) check, even with poor reasoning beforehand, can simply show that an NPC is willing to give the character the benefit of the doubt. A poor Charisma (Intimidation) roll, even if the odds are stacked against the NPC, may reveal that the NPC has a sudden boost of morale from a secret plan they have. And a poor Charisma (Deception) check, even if what the PC said is totally believable, may show that the NPC is simply a suspicious type who has a nose for danger.

In this way, Charisma can be seen not just as force of will in a direct sense, but a type of social luck—the ability for things to go well for a player character. After all, luck is an important skill to have as an adventurer.

Charisma checks with NPCs are usually contested by Wisdom (Insight) checks. To avoid undue rolling and putting the need for luck on the players' shoulders, it is usually best to use the NPC's passive Insight score. Depending on the situation and the actions of the character, this score can be modified. Use the Insight Modifiers table as a guideline. Try to limit the modifiers to 2 or less: one for the NPC's attitude toward the character, and another for the situation.

Social Charisma checks should be avoided as a tool NPCs use against player characters. These can push the suspension of disbelief players already have to its limits. Charisma (Deception) checks are acceptable for an NPC attempting to hide something from the party, though passive Deception scores are better used as DCs for an insightful player's Wisdom (Insight) checks instead.

Finally, Charisma checks should never be used between party members. Any such conflict should be handled in and out of character, with players adjudicating their own characters' response.

## SKILLS

This section describes adjudication rules for each skill.

running start.

\* The DC for a given climbing example increases by 5 if the surface is slick with liquid but decreases by 5 if you have decent handholds or a properly-secured rope.

### ACROBATICS

Acrobatics is not a replacement for the Athletics skill. Instead, it has very specific implementations that are usually done passively or as part of some other action: keeping one's balance, slipping out of tight spaces, and of course performing acrobatic stunts.

### ANIMAL HANDLING

Animal Handling sees perhaps the least use in most campaigns. If someone takes it, try to give them a few chances to use it, even if it's only once or twice every few sessions.

If the check is made under external threats, such as during combat or while avoiding an ongoing lava flow, increase the DC by 5. Having something the animal wants (especially food) can give a character advantage on the check.

### ARCANA

The Arcana skill is not just for recalling information about magic, identifying spells and such. It can be used to figure out how a magical device functions, or to disable magical traps. Given the nature of Dungeons & Dragons' settings, the Arcana skill should have plenty of instances to shine.

Arcana is also the most versatile knowledge skill when it comes to monsters. It can be used to recall information about the abilities of most aberrations, celestials, most constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, monstrosities created by magic, some oozes, and most undead, as Arcana covers knowledge about spells, magic, and the planes all in one.

### ATHLETICS

Climbing, jumping, and swimming should remain purely in the playhouse of Strength. Dexterity and the Acrobatics skill should not be applied to these given activities, to keep Strength a relevant, obvious solution to problems these can solve.

Example DCs can be found in the Athletics DCs table.

Climbing. Scaling an incline is an easy task that should not require an ability check, even a steep one given generous handholds. Failure should not mean a deadly fall. A Dexterity saving throw of a lesser DC can sometimes be allowed to stay in place. In most cases, failing simply causes one to slide back down unless under immediate duress and threat of injury.

Calling for a check at all is only really required if the situation is appropriately dangerous. An entire party could scale a steep cliff without much effort, so long as there is nothing nipping at their heels or waiting at the top for them.

Jumping. The Athletics skill states that it can be used to jump unusually long distances. Only call for such a check if a character could not make it with their default jumping distance, detailed in the rules for movement.

### DECEPTION

Due to its situational nature, Deception is usually used in contests alone, opposed by an NPC's Wisdom (Insight) check. Generally, it's best to use passive Insight scores to set a DC for the check, with adjustments based on the attitude of the NPC. Insight in this case is used in its closest rules-as-written form, allowing an NPC to detect whether a PC is pulling their leg. 

The Insight Modifiers table in the previous section contains guidelines for modifying an NPC's Insight score to set a DC for a character's Charisma (Deception) checks.

### INSIGHT

Insight is yet another skill used in contests more often than flat checks. Unlike NPCs, PCs do not get situational bonuses to their Wisdom (Insight) checks, instead relying on the player's own wit. However, in a pinch with no leads, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to get a hunch that something is amiss or not. If the DM so decides, they may provide the player with some sort of hint to go along with the hunch, such as "People's eyes keep glancing at the beautiful tapestry on the far wall" to denote that people might be hiding something.

On a failed check to notice an NPC's bluff, the DM should be careful not to show their hand. Too often, even a failed check can tell the player that their suspicions are at least partially correct, instead of revealing little or no information. When describing a failure to detect a bluff, try to say that a character has trouble getting a good read on the NPC, rather than saying that the character finds the NPC trustworthy.

### HISTORY

Unlike Arcana, History is dedicated almost entirely to recalling information. Its use is quite specific as well. In a pinch, the skill can be used past its normal intentions to recall information about the local region, such as local nobles, recent battles, and local feuds or problems.

It can also be used to recall information about particularly impactful monsters. Information about dragons, giants, and humanoids tends to fit best in the History skill. Depending on the setting, it may help recall information about other monsters.

Like Deception, Intimidation is often contested by a Wisdom (Insight) check or, more smoothly, an NPC's passive Insight score. The Insight Modifiers table in the previous section contains guidelines for modifying an NPC's Insight score to set a DC for a character's Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

Many players attempt to use this skill in combat. While tempting, the DM should not use the frightened condition in this case, as it steps on the toes of many class features and spells. Instead, use Intimidation checks as a way to affect morale. A high Intimidation check accompanied by the slaying an opponent may cause weaker enemies to retreat. A low Intimidation check may make stronger enemies more aggressive. In either case, the Insight skill is used to represent not just a creature's ability to read a situation but also to show their self-awareness, whether they can avoid being overcome by fear in the heat of battle or not.

### INVESTIGATION

This skill is the "black sheep" of the fifth edition skill system. Often confused with Perception in its use, the difference between the two is often vague, both in rules and in various official adventures.

The best way to illustrate this is with a common Dungeons & Dragon element: traps. Perception can be used to spot a trap. You can see the shine of torchlight on a trip wire, or the slight separation between stones indicating a pressure plate. Investigation allows you to figure out how a trap works. It lets you notice that the trip wire is likely attached something that comes down from the slots in the ceiling, or that the pressure plate likely has to do with the holes in the walls.

It may also be better to think about them in terms of scale. Perception is for things that are obvious, out in the open. You could notice them at a glance, given a high enough awareness. Investigation is for seeing smaller-scale things, such as that a single book in a bookcase is out of place, with a different subject than the others.

Like Insight, Investigation can be used by DMs to move a campaign along. If players have found clues but aren't connecting them, an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Investigation) check may help them put 2 and 2 together.

### MEDICINE

Yet another underused skill, Medicine can have more uses than just stabilizing a dying ally in combat. Medicine can be used in place of other Intelligence-based checks to recall information and determine the nature of poisons and diseases, especially when they are affecting a creature. In many cases, Intelligence (Medicine) checks are even more apt than Wisdom (Medicine) checks, though medicine in D&D is often based on gut-feelings rather than the modern method of rote learning.

MEDICINE DCS

Check DC    Situation

5    Determine that someone has a cold.

Recall how to treat common ailments.

10    Identify fresh wounds and determine how they were made in most cases.

15    Determine the exact cause of death of the recently deceased. Determine how to treat a rare poison or disease.

20    Identify a specific poison or disease by only cursory descriptions or symptoms.

25    Find the cure or treatment for a magical disease.

30    Raise a creature that has recently died not through magic but your skill alone.

### NATURE

Nature is one of the wider Intelligence skills, usable in a host of situations, especially to recall information about beasts, the wilder dragons, many fey, primal humanoids, common monstrosities, and of course plants.

In some cases, Wisdom (Nature) checks may be appropriate. Consider allowing these for rangers and druids, who are close to nature but whose Intelligence scores are generally not all that high.

NATURE DCS

Check DC Situation

5    Identify common plants and animals.

10    Recall that a neighboring desert is infamous for its ice storms, or that the local forest is guarded by vengeful fey.

15    Determine that a storm is artificial, that a cliff face is actually an unnatural fagade, or that a specific animal usually isn't found in the area.

20    Identify that a creature is one-of-a- kind or possibly a new species.

25    Pinpoint the depth and epicenter of an earthquake from eyewitness reports.

30    Determine that a nearby mountain is going to erupt within the next few days.

### PERCEPTION

Being one of the most-used skills, Perception needs little encouragement in its use. Perception is also the one skill focused on for passive scores. For NPCs, passive Perception use is a must to speed up play, but for characters, encouraging regular active use of the Perception skill can keep play active. While some say to use passive Perception as a hard minimum for Wisdom (Perception) checks, it can be useful to completely ignore it for active checks where failure could be more interesting, exciting, or dangerous.

PERCEPTION DCS

Check DC Situation

5 Hear people talking in the next room, or see someone walking in the trees.

10 Hear people whispering in the next room.

15 Read the lips of someone across the room.

20 Hear and understand whispers from a room over, or see the telltale signs of a secret door.

25 Hear an owl gliding in for a kill.

30 See the outline of an invisible creature, or hear an invisible creature's heartbeat from some distance.

### PERFORMANCE

The Performance skill is often misunderstood, largely because musical instrument proficiencies are kept separate from it. Performance can, in most cases, be thought of a catch-all proficiency for artistic pursuits with one's physical body: storytelling, singing, dancing, and so on. Beyond this, it can be used to cover how a character's performance influences or distracts an audience, no matter the instrument or lack thereof.

Like the rules for artisan's tools in Xanathars Guide to Everything, proficiency in Performance and a musical instrument can synergize. If a character makes a Charisma (Performance) check using an instrument with which they are proficient, the DM can grant them advantage on the check.

PERFORMANCE DCS

Check DC Situation

5 Put on a series of shows barely interesting enough to pay for your hotel room.

10 Entertain people enough to tell their friends.

15 Recite a poem with such emotion that it brings people to tears.

20 Put on an award-winning performance, earning calls for an encore.

Check DC Situation

25 Distract every person on the street, even those chasing after the rest of your party, perhaps even gaining the attention of distant patrons and extraplanar beings.

30 Give a performance worthy of the history books, changing the local scene for years to come.

### PERSUASION

The last of the three major Charisma skills, Persuasion is also the most-used. Influencing an NPC to do what you want is an important skill to have! As such, it is often opposed by an NPC's passive Insight score, with adjustments based on the attitude of the NPC as given in the Insight Modifiers table in the previous section.

In this case, using the Insight score might not make sense, at first. Just like Intimidation, consider the Insight score as a way to represent not only the ability to detect lies but a sort of luck created by situational awareness. A creature with a large bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks is more likely to foresee negative outcomes to doing what the party wants or even associating with them.

The DM should try to only call for Charisma (Persuasion) checks when the NPC in question wouldn't perform or refuse to perform the action in question. A close ally may already give their life for the party, but a villain will surely reject any requests the party makes that don't fit their fell fancy.

Finally, the Persuasion skill can be used to handwave the gathering of rumors. Searching for information or rumors on a specific subject in a town might take a few hours and a DC 10 or 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, allowing characters to move the story forward while others shop or rest.

### RELIGION

Religion is the narrowest of the Intelligence skills. DMs coming from older editions often use it beyond its stated scope, though this has little impact on the game itself. In truth, Intelligence (Religion) checks may rarely come up in a game not involved with cults or religious organizations.

That's not to say it's completely useless. It can be used to recall information on many celestials, fiends, and some undead, as they relate to cults and deities.

RELIGION DCS

Check DC Situation

5 Recognize holy symbols of common deities.

10 Recall the rites and major traditions of common religions, enough to fit in at a church.

Check DC Situation

15 Determine which deity or cult an ancient ruin was dedicated to, or recall information on local mythology.

20 Recognize the secret symbols and actions of cultists hiding their dealings in plain sight.

25 Recognize the symbols and myths of a god dead and buried for 10,000 years.

30 Improvise the proper rites of a long- dead religion to contact its sleeping god.

### SLEIGHT OF HAND

This skill could, in many ways, simply be combined with the Stealth skill. However, it still does have its uses and can come up in play, if not all that often. This will mostly occur through the Steal action, but Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks can be used for pulling magic tricks or carefully manipulating small objects.

Like the Stealth skill, Sleight of Hand is almost always opposed by a creature's Wisdom (Perception) check or passive Perception score, with almost no exceptions. A soft DC 10 can be used to perform some simple acts of manual trickery, such as using a fishhook and line to grab a set of keys from a jail cell.

### STEALTH

Stealth is perhaps the most well-defined skill in Dungeons & Dragons. It is used for anything involving stealth, and it is always contested by a creature's Wisdom (Perception) check or passive Perception score.

To smooth play, do not call for repeated Dexterity (Stealth) checks when a character is simply moving through an area. Instead, only ask for another check if the character is spotted or performs a specific action that could break their stealth. A Dexterity (Stealth) check of 17 could get a creature past most guards and sentries, even passing across doorways or moving within a few feet of an unaware guard. However, once a character attempts to take out a guard or after a character activates a trap, a second check may be worthwhile, as the situation can change dramatically.

### SURVIVAL

Survival is yet another well-defined skill. The guidelines in the Dungeon Master's Guide on foraging, navigation, and tracking all give solid DCs on the skill's use.

When cook's utensils aren't available (or a character isn't proficient in with them), Wisdom (Survival) checks can be used to determine if a proper meal is prepared by an unskilled chef. A DC of 10 is usually more than enough to produce something edible from wild game and plants, with a 15 or 20 giving a much-needed morale boost in the wilderness in the form of a delicious, if gamey, meal. This morale boost can be presented by temporary hit points, usually 1d4.
