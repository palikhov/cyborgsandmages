## BATTLEMAGE

Trained in weaponry, mounted combat, and destructive arcane traditions, battlemages are potent spellcasters and warriors. They sur¬vey the field near and far, turning the tide with their martial prowess and the seemingly endless reach of their spells.

### Battlefield Training

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light and medium armor and with one melee weapon of your choice. You also gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill.

### Battlemage's Fortitude

Also starting at 2nd level, you may apply your proficiency bonus on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.

### Battlefield Magic

Beginning at 6th level, you learn counterspell. In addition, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Battlemage's Reach

Starting at 10th level, when you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can double its range. Alternately, if you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can make the range of the spell 30 feet.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Overchannel

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, reduce your current hit points by 2d12 per level of the spell immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the hit point reduction per spell level increases by 1d12.

### BATTLE WIZARD

Wizard Alternate Class

Not all wizards concern themselves solely with scholastic matters. Some take an interdisciplinary approach to combat, forgoing certain magical studies to train extensively with martial weapons.

### Arcane Weapon Training

Alternate Class Feature (Cantrips class feature)

You know only one cantrip of your choice from the wizard list at 1st level, and do not gain additional cantrips at 4th and 10th level.

Choose three one-handed martial weapons. You gain proficiency in these weapons, and they function as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

## FIRE WIZARD

Fire has always had a lure of its own. Wizards have sought its power for reasons varying from intellectual to revenge. Fire Wizards can be found across the Known World, from Glantrian nobility to evil worshipers of Alphaks to the reclusive Fire Wizards of Ierendi. Due to their varied backgrounds, fire wizards tend to be treated differently by each nation. In Thyatis, they are valued for their destructive capabilities as well as their long¬standing feud with Alphatia. In the Principality of Bergdhoven in Glantri, fire wizards are the norm for mages. Only in Alfheim are fire wizards viewed as dangerous to all, and unofficially banned from the nation. All incarnations of Fire Wizards try and master the element for their purposes.

Fire Wizards have been a part of the Known World for centuries. As such, they are found all over the continent in many nations. They are considered highly mysterious, but not necessarily evil. Some study fire to use as a weapon against their foes, others to learn more about the Elemental Plane of Fire, and yet more have made the study of fire part of their cultural heritage. No other element is studied more than fire, save maybe the air wizards of Alphatia. Because of the destructive nature of their mastery, most fire wizards are reclusive, not wanting to hurt others accidentally or so they can research the element uninterrupted. Fire wizards often become adventurers to test their theories or gain experience to increase their skills.

### Pyromancer

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell that manipulates fire, creates fire or deals fire damage is halved.

### Born in Fire

When you reach 2nd level, you gain immunity to non- magical fire damage; at 14th level, you become immune to magical fire. Also, when you cast a damaging spell, you can change the damage to fire damage. Spells altered this way do not qualify for the Inferno ability.

### Stifle the Blaze

You have begun to master the fire, controlling it with just a thought. At 6th level, as a reaction, any allies you choose within 20 feet of you gain resistance to fire for one round.

### Summon Elemental

When you reach 10th level, you can conjure a fire elemental exactly as the spell. The elemental is considered friendly, and if you lose concentration, the elemental returns to the Plane of Fire rather than becoming hostile. You regain the use of this ability after a long rest.

### Inferno

Now your flames burn white-hot, you can exert yourself to turn a simple flame into a conflagration. At 14th level, you can choose to do maximum damage with any spell of 5th level or lower that does fire damage. You regain the use of this ability after a long rest.

## GUNMAGE

A curl of arcane exhaust curls up from the barrel of a gun like smoke. The wizard's opponent falls to the ground, dead in the harsh noon sunlight. The Gun Mage holsters their Arcane Arm and strides back into the saloon, their supremacy in this here town settled.

Strange wanderers through the waists, Gun Mages channel their magic through their iconic firearms and infuse their spells into eldritch bullets. Mortal and monster alike have learned to fear the lightning quick reflexes and unparalleled range of these vagabonds.

Each Gun Mage's gun is unique to them, some are made out of inlaid brass, others carved from the bones of an unknown monstrosity, some are lovingly crafted by their mage, others are passed down from a dear mentor, and an infamous few were picked from the rapidly cooling corpse of their former master.

When making your Gun Mage consider carefully the firearm they use, what it looks like and how your wizard came to possess it.

### Hair Trigger

2nd-level wizard feature

You may add your intelligence modifier to your initiative bonus.

### Arcane Arms

2nd-level wizard feature

You gain proficiency with firearms.

Additionally you come into the possession of a mystic firearm that you can use as an arcane focus for casting wizard spells. When you cast a spell using this firearm as a focus you can triple the range of any spell that requires a ranged spell attack.

### Arcane Bullets

6th-level wizard feature

You learn to enchant special bullets, infusing them with spells from your spellbook. When you complete a long rest you may cast a number of spells up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) from your spellbook, you do not have to have prepared these spells but they can't be higher than 5th level and their casting time must be an action. Once cast these spells are infused into arcane bullets.

A creature in possession of one of these bullets may load it into any firearm and fire it as an action, releasing the spell within. THe spell uses your spell attack bonus and save DC, but the range is replaced with the range of the firearm used to fire the bullet. The spell treats the creature who fired the bullet as the caster for all other purposes.

When you complete a long rest all previously infused bullets loose their magic and become regular bullets again.

### Condensed Arcanite Bullets

10th-level wizard feature

When you fire an Arcane Bullet that contains a spell that would force a creature to make a Dexterity Saving Throw, instead you may make a ranged spell attack against a single creature within range, on a hit they suffer the effects as if they failed the saving throw.

### Quick Draw

14th-level wizard feature

When you roll initiative and are not surprised, you may use your reaction to cast a spell through your Arcane Arms or fire an Arcane Bullet. If you use this reaction you can not cast spells or fire your firearm during your first turn in combat.

## MERCHANT PRINCE WIZARD SCHOOL

Darokin and Minrothad live by their economic strength. They have to protect their trade routes by any means.

Both nations have employed a group of wizards, the merchant princes, to ensure economic superiority. While the wizards aren't as focused on a school of magic as their counterparts, in exchange, they have greater access to spells and specialized training in magic items. The vast wealth they tend to acquire also helps.

While merchant princes work exclusively with Darokin and Minrothad, they are found in every single country in the Known World. From the plateau of Atruaghin, where Darokin enjoys a monopoly to the Isle of Dread, where Minrothad trades exclusively with the coastal villages, merchant princes are everywhere. Devoted to increasing and protecting trades for their guilds, the princes can be found in every major city, trading house, and port. Even in hostile territory, they will be accompanying their caravans and ships to keep hostile bandits or monsters at bay. Because they are well compensated for their skills, they are typically found in the nicer parts of towns, though they will be found everywhere if there is money to be made.

### Great Library

At 2nd level, the cost to scribe all spells is reduced by half. You gain an additional spell every time you gain a wizard level.

### Appraiser

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast identify without using a spell slot or components.

### Mercantile Training

When you reach 6th level, you add double your wizard level when rolling on the Running W a Business and Selling a Magic Item downtime charts. You also gain proficiency in the Insight skill.

### Zone of Truth

At 10th level, anyone attempting to lie to you must pass a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be forced to tell the whole

truth.

### Wealth is Power

When you reach 14th level, you can attune an additional magic item.

## SCHOOL OF CHRONOMANCY

Your magic has revealed to you the secrets of time itself. You have devoted your studies to better controlling and mastering time. Few are able to find this path and fewer still succeed in it. To master this school is to understand the fabric of the universe beyond that of the realms of magic. There are no known schools or academies that teach chronomancy and chronomancers are incredibly rare on Oerik.

### SLOW TIME

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you learn to accelerate time around yourself causing the world to appear slower in comparison. When you activate this feature you can take two actions per turn instead of one but the extra action cannot be used on the Cast a Spell action. In addition you have advantage on all Dexterity saving throws. This effect lasts for 1 minute and you cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### TIMEKEEPER

Starting at 2nd level, you have developed an innate sense of the flow of time around you. You always know the time, date and year of where you are located. As an action, you can detect any distortions in time within a 60-foot radius of where you are standing. This ability is not blocked by physical obstructions, though it cannot reach past magically created barriers such as a wall of force or a tiny hut.

At 6th level, the range of this ability increase to 120 feet. At 10th level, the range of this ability increase to 240 feet. At 14th level, the range of this ability increases to 1 mile.

### SHELTER OF TIME

Beginning at 6th level, you’ve learned how to conserve time. You now only require half the time for short or long rest. A short rest for you is only half and hour and you gain the benefits of a long rest after only 4 hours.

The amount of time you need to rest is reduced by half (30 mins / 4 hours). This feature stacks with other sleep-related effects and features.

### TIME STEP

At 10th level, you may move by stepping out of back into the time-stream. You may cast the Dimension Door spell at will as a bonus action.

### OUT OF TIME

At 14th level, your connection to the time stream is so strong that you can appear to be in more than one location at a time through the use of time duplicates. You create a time duplicate of yourself that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus after which it disappears back into the time-stream.

You control the time duplicate as though it were a second PC and the duplicate gets an initiative roll and a turn in combat but shares your spells slots. The duplicate hasthe same AC, hit points and conditions that you had at the time if its creation. You may create one duplicate at a time, creating a second immediately dispels the first.

## SCHOOL OF ONOMANCY

This obscure arcane tradition is known to few beyond the wizards who form the minority Anchorites of the Silent Ones, and the Imperial Mages of the Celestial Bureaucracy, both of whom practice this tradition.

Both organizations put an emphasis on recording, and controlling access to magic.

Practitioners of magic well know the power of names, but wizards who follow the tradition of Onomancy use their magic to manipulate the words that encompass existence. Onomancers expand their study into language itself, searching for threads of magical significance that weave through names. Something that is named stands out in the multiverse, distinct from the tapestry of creation all around it.

That distinction creates power that onomancers seek to tap. By speaking a target’s true name, the wizard’s spells slip between the cracks of the target’s defenses, conforming to its essential nature through the power of its name. To protect themselves, wizards who follow this tradition often hide their true names, typically by adopting monikers and pseudonyms.

### BONUS PROFICIENCIES

At 2nd level, you learn one language of your choice and gain proficiency with calligrapher’s tools.

### EXTRACT NAME

At 2nd level, you can magically compel a creature to divulge its true name. As a bonus action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, you discern that this magic failed, and you can’t use this feature on the target again. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn, and you mentally learn the charmed target’s name or the fact that the target lacks a name.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### FATEFUL NAMING

Starting at 2nd level, you can bend magic to assist or hinder creatures through the power of their true names, and even use those names as an anchor to affect others around them. The bane and bless spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook. You always have them prepared, yet they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare.

You can cast either spell without expending a spell slot if you speak the true name of one target of the spell as part of casting it. You can cast the spells in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### RESONANT UTTERANCE

At 6th level, you learn words of power called Resonants,which allow you to tailor your spells through the use of a target’s true name.

**Resonants Known.** When you gain this feature, you learn two Resonants of your choice, which are detailed in the “Resonant Options” section. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one resonant you know with a different one.

**Using a Resonant.** You can use one Resonant when you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. Speaking the name is part of casting the spell.

You can use Resonants a number of times equal to half of your wizard level (round down), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Resonant Options.** Here are your options when choosing a Resonant:

**Absorption.** When you cast a spell that deals damage to the named target, you gain 3d6 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points you gain increases by 1d6 when you reach 10th level (4d6) and 14th level (5d6) in this class.

**Devastation.** If the spell requires the named creature to make a saving throw, that creature has disadvantage on the first save it makes against the spell.

**Dissolution.** The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, that creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage. The extra force damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 10th level (3d8) and 14th level (4d8) in this class.

**Nullification.** If the named target is affected by any other spells, you know what those spells are, and you can attempt to end one of your choice by succeeding on an Intelligence check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spell.

**Puppetry.** The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, you can knock the creature prone or move it up to 10 feet, either directly toward you or away from you.

**Sympathy.** If the named creature is within range of the spell, you can target the creature with the spell even if you can’t see the creature or it has total cover against the spell.

### DURABLE MAGIC

Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.

### INEXORABLE PRONOUNCEMENT

At 10th level, you learn two new Resonants of your choice from your Resonant Utterance feature.

### RELENTLESS NAMING

At 14th level, you have learned how to bypass a named creature’s defenses against certain types of damage. When you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature whose true name you speak as part of casting the spell, you can cause the spell to deal force or psychic damage to the creature, instead of the spell’s normal damage type.

## SCHOOL OF SWORDMAGE

The War Wizards of Cormyr recruit from many different wizard colleges, including some located in Cormyr it-self, and from many backgrounds and specialties. Among the more recent wizard academies in Cormyr is the Academy Orbyn named for the longsword crafted by the High Mage Amedahast. The academy is jointly taught by a retired battlemaster of the Purple Drag-ons and a member of the War Wizards. They teach both martial combat as well as the arcane arts, an approach embraced by former High Mage Caladnei.

### Spellblade

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level,  you gain proficiency with light armor, greatswords, longswords, shortswords, rapiers, and scimitars.

In addition, you may perform a brief ritual when you finish a long rest. During this ritual, you may bond to any melee weapon with which you are proficient. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. You may use the weapon as an arcane focus for your Wizard spells, and may perform the somatic components of Wizard spells even if you are wielding a weapon in both hands.

This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

### Arcane Regeneration

Beginning at 6th level, as a bonus action you may expend a Wizard spell slot to regain hit points equal to 1d8 per level of the spell slot you expended. You must then finish a short or long rest to use this ability again.

### Arcane Blade

Starting at 10th level, you can use your magic to enhance your weapon. Your spellblade does an additional 1d8 damage when you hit with a melee attack. This extra damage can be acid, cold, fire,  lightning, or thunder damage, chosen when you bond with your spellblade. At 14th level the additional damage increases to 1d10.

### Mystic Assault

Beginning at 14th level, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn you may use a bonus action to cast a spell with a casting time of one action.

## SEA MAGIC

Not a school in the traditional sense, Sea Wizards (often referred to as Sea Mages) are wizards with situational training much like war wizards. Instead of learning their magic behind a book in a dusty tower, Sea Wizards are merchants, sailors and pirates who have taken to the high seas to hone their craft. You may summon a wind gust to help guide the ship along or foretell a coming storm.

### CHARM OF THE SEA

The first thing a Sea Wizard learns is to create a small charm to help him survive and thrive on the high seas. The charm can be any small worn or carried item such as a piece of driftwood or an idol. The charm grants one ability at 2nd level and an additional ability at 6th, 10th and 14th. You may change type of charm selected after a long rest. The charm bestows its protections on anyone wearing it, but loses its potency at the end of long rest if it is not restored by the Sea Wizard.

Water breathing

Swim Speed of 30 and 60 foot darkvision

The ability to communicate with marine based animals using simple gestures and sounds

Advantage on Acrobatic Checks

### ADDITIONAL FAMILIARS

When casting the Find Familiar spell you may select from the following additional creatures as familiars: Parrot, Monkey, Crab (see Appendix A)

### THE WIND AT YOUR BACK

At 6th level you may use your Intelligence modifier instead of your dexterity modifier for Dexterity saving throws. In addition, when you cast the spell Gust of Wind, you can change the duration to Concentration (up to 1 hour).

### EVASION

Beginning at 10th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### MAN OVERBOARD

At 14th level you may, as an action, summon force bubbles around a number of visible, willing creatures other than yourself equal to your proficiency modifier. Each force bubble has 50 hps, an AC of 8 and contains 1 hour of breathable air. This effect lasts for 1 hour, requires concentration and may not be used again until a long rest is completed. It acts similar to the spell Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere with the above exceptions.

 

## TREEKEEPER

Sacred wizards of the Canolbarth forest, treekeepers are responsible for maintaining the magic of the great forest. Though their powers are arcane, not divine, the elves are often mistaken for druids. Their harmony with nature is so innate they can change theve^ climate around them. While not divine casters, the elves mimic the druids' spells with similar magics created to maintain the Canolbarth forest. Indeed, treekeepers are longtime allies of druids % and the fey that walk the glades of the woods.

Together they protect the elven nation from those that would harm or exploit it.

Treekeepers are most commonly found in Alfheim wandering the trails and walking among the home trees there. Those that follow the path of the treekeeper rarely have any reason to leave their homeland, for it is the source of their power. Though treekeepers are sworn to protect the wood from all threats, some more prescient treekeepers know that there is danger outside of

Alfheim that threatens their homeland. Many elf tribes outside of Alfheim use treekeepers to maintain their forests, learning the secrets from Alfheim wizards. While elven forests outside of Alfheim are far less impressive, the magic of the treekeepers still works. Some treekeepers wander into the human lands, or even into the wild growth timber forests that dot the top of

Rockhome. Treekeepers are often what outsiders think of when they think of elven wizards, a perspective that most elves are happy to maintain.

Restriction: Must be a sylvan elf.

### Treewalker

At 2nd level, you ignore difficult terrain while in a forest.

### Magic of the Canolbarth

Treekeepers are often confused with clerics or druids because they can tap into the primordial magic that the Canolbarth forest contains. While you are not a true druid, some of their secrets are revealed to you by the sylvan realm. When you learn new spells for gaining a level, you may substitute one druid spell for one of your wizard spells. Only treekeepers can learn druid spells this way; they cannot be taught to other wizards, not even other Treekeepers.

### WiseintheOld Ways

At 6th level, you gain advantage on all Animal Handling, Nature and Medicine skill checks. You learn the Sylvan language.

Protector of the

### Woods

You are starting to become one with the forest. Now when you focus, you can see what the trees can see and have learned to harmonize your magic to avoid hurting the trees and other plants native to the Canolbarth. At 10th level, you can see through trees as if they were not there and can cast a spell without harming plants if they are caught in an area of effect spell.

You can cast spells as if trees were not in the way.

### One with Nature

Youcanspeaktothe floraand the fauna as if they were just another person. You have also learned to move through the forest effortlessly with only the force of your will. At 14th level, you can cast speak with animal or plant without using a spell slot. You can cast tree stride a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier per day.

I've got a pressure-activated deadfall rigged to at least two load-bearing rafters, both keyed to a triple-redundant counterweight that anyone of you could set off while you take out the orcs. That's not taking into account the fact there are no fewer than a dozen poison dart launchers ready to fire all around the room. So I can drop what I'm doing and stab an orc for you, or I can sit here and do what you are paying me quite handsomely to do. So I will tell you what, you take care of the orcs, and I will take care of the traps.

## BATTLEMAGE

Trained in weaponry, mounted combat, and destructive arcane traditions, battlemages are potent spellcasters and warriors. They sur¬vey the field near and far, turning the tide with their martial prowess and the seemingly endless reach of their spells.

### BATTLEMAGE'S REACH

Starting at 10th level, when you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can double its range. Alternately, if you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can make the range of the spell 30 feet.

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the hit point reduction per spell level increases by 1d12.

## FIRE WIZARD

Fire has always had a lure of its own. Wizards have sought its power for reasons varying from intellectual to revenge. Fire Wizards can be found across the Known World, from Glantrian nobility to evil worshipers of Alphaks to the reclusive Fire Wizards of Ierendi. Due to their varied backgrounds, fire wizards tend to be treated differently by each nation.

## GUNMAGE

A curl of arcane exhaust curls up from the barrel of a gun like smoke. The wizard's opponent falls to the ground, dead in the harsh noon sunlight. The Gun Mage holsters their Arcane Arm and strides back into the saloon, their supremacy in this here town settled.

Strange wanderers through the waists, Gun Mages channel their magic through their iconic firearms and infuse their spells into eldritch bullets. Mortal and monster alike have learned to fear the lightning quick reflexes and unparalleled range of these vagabonds.

Each Gun Mage's gun is unique to them, some are made out of inlaid brass, others carved from the bones of an unknown monstrosity, some are lovingly crafted by their mage, others are passed down from a dear mentor, and an infamous few were picked from the rapidly cooling corpse of their former master.

From the plateau of Atruaghin, where Darokin enjoys a monopoly to the Isle of Dread, where Minrothad trades exclusively with the coastal villages, merchant princes are everywhere. Devoted to increasing and protecting trades for their guilds, the princes can be found in every major city, trading house, and port. Even in hostile territory, they will be accompanying their caravans and ships to keep hostile bandits or monsters at bay. Because they are well compensated for their skills, they are typically found in the nicer parts of towns, though they will be found everywhere if there is money to be made.

## SCHOOL OF CHRONOMANCY

Your magic has revealed to you the secrets of time itself. You have devoted your studies to better controlling and mastering time. Few are able to find this path and fewer still succeed in it. To master this school is to understand the fabric of the universe beyond that of the realms of magic. There are no known schools or academies that teach chronomancy and chronomancers are incredibly rare on Oerik.

### SLOW TIME

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you learn to accelerate time around yourself causing the world to appear slower in comparison. When you activate this feature you can take two actions per turn instead of one but the extra action cannot be used on the Cast a Spell action. In addition you have advantage on all Dexterity saving throws. This effect lasts for 1 minute and you cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### TIMEKEEPER

Starting at 2nd level, you have developed an innate sense of the flow of time around you. You always know the time, date and year of where you are located. As an action, you can detect any distortions in time within a 60-foot radius of where you are standing. This ability is not blocked by physical obstructions, though it cannot reach past magically created barriers such as a wall of force or a tiny hut.

At 6th level, the range of this ability increase to 120 feet. At 10th level, the range of this ability increase to 240 feet. At 14th level, the range of this ability increases to 1 mile.

### SHELTER OF TIME

Beginning at 6th level, you’ve learned how to conserve time. You now only require half the time for short or long rest. A short rest for you is only half and hour and you gain the benefits of a long rest after only 4 hours.

The amount of time you need to rest is reduced by half (30 mins / 4 hours). This feature stacks with other sleep-related effects and features.

### TIME STEP

At 10th level, you may move by stepping out of back into the time-stream. You may cast the Dimension Door spell at will as a bonus action.

### OUT OF TIME

At 14th level, your connection to the time stream is so strong that you can appear to be in more than one location at a time through the use of time duplicates. You create a time duplicate of yourself that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus after which it disappears back into the time-stream.

You control the time duplicate as though it were a second PC and the duplicate gets an initiative roll and a turn in combat but shares your spells slots. The duplicate hasthe same AC, hit points and conditions that you had at the time if its creation. You may create one duplicate at a time, creating a second immediately dispels the first.

## SCHOOL OF ONOMANCY

This obscure arcane tradition is known to few beyond the wizards who form the minority Anchorites of the Silent Ones, and the Imperial Mages of the Celestial Bureaucracy, both of whom practice this tradition.

Both organizations put an emphasis on recording, and controlling access to magic.

Practitioners of magic well know the power of names, but wizards who follow the tradition of Onomancy use their magic to manipulate the words that encompass existence. Onomancers expand their study into language itself, searching for threads of magical significance that weave through names. Something that is named stands out in the multiverse, distinct from the tapestry of creation all around it.

That distinction creates power that onomancers seek to tap. By speaking a target’s true name, the wizard’s spells slip between the cracks of the target’s defenses, conforming to its essential nature through the power of its name. To protect themselves, wizards who follow this tradition often hide their true names, typically by adopting monikers and pseudonyms.

### BONUS PROFICIENCIES

At 2nd level, you learn one language of your choice and gain proficiency with calligrapher’s tools.

### EXTRACT NAME

At 2nd level, you can magically compel a creature to divulge its true name. As a bonus action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, you discern that this magic failed, and you can’t use this feature on the target again. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn, and you mentally learn the charmed target’s name or the fact that the target lacks a name.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### FATEFUL NAMING

Starting at 2nd level, you can bend magic to assist or hinder creatures through the power of their true names, and even use those names as an anchor to affect others around them. The bane and bless spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook. You always have them prepared, yet they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare.

You can cast either spell without expending a spell slot if you speak the true name of one target of the spell as part of casting it. You can cast the spells in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### RESONANT UTTERANCE

At 6th level, you learn words of power called Resonants,which allow you to tailor your spells through the use of a target’s true name.

**Resonants Known.** When you gain this feature, you learn two Resonants of your choice, which are detailed in the “Resonant Options” section. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one resonant you know with a different one.

**Using a Resonant.** You can use one Resonant when you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. Speaking the name is part of casting the spell.

You can use Resonants a number of times equal to half of your wizard level (round down), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Resonant Options.** Here are your options when choosing a Resonant:

**Absorption.** When you cast a spell that deals damage to the named target, you gain 3d6 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points you gain increases by 1d6 when you reach 10th level (4d6) and 14th level (5d6) in this class.

**Devastation.** If the spell requires the named creature to make a saving throw, that creature has disadvantage on the first save it makes against the spell.

**Dissolution.** The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, that creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage. The extra force damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 10th level (3d8) and 14th level (4d8) in this class.

**Nullification.** If the named target is affected by any other spells, you know what those spells are, and you can attempt to end one of your choice by succeeding on an Intelligence check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spell.

**Puppetry.** The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, you can knock the creature prone or move it up to 10 feet, either directly toward you or away from you.

**Sympathy.** If the named creature is within range of the spell, you can target the creature with the spell even if you can’t see the creature or it has total cover against the spell.

### DURABLE MAGIC

Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.

### INEXORABLE PRONOUNCEMENT

At 10th level, you learn two new Resonants of your choice from your Resonant Utterance feature.

### RELENTLESS NAMING

At 14th level, you have learned how to bypass a named creature’s defenses against certain types of damage. When you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature whose true name you speak as part of casting the spell, you can cause the spell to deal force or psychic damage to the creature, instead of the spell’s normal damage type.

## SCHOOL OF SWORDMAGE

The War Wizards of Cormyr recruit from many different wizard colleges, including some located in Cormyr it-self, and from many backgrounds and specialties. Among the more recent wizard academies in Cormyr is the Academy Orbyn named for the longsword crafted by the High Mage Amedahast. The academy is jointly taught by a retired battlemaster of the Purple Drag-ons and a member of the War Wizards. They teach both martial combat as well as the arcane arts, an approach embraced by former High Mage Caladnei.

### Spellblade

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level,  you gain proficiency with light armor, greatswords, longswords, shortswords, rapiers, and scimitars.

In addition, you may perform a brief ritual when you finish a long rest. During this ritual, you may bond to any melee weapon with which you are proficient. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. You may use the weapon as an arcane focus for your Wizard spells, and may perform the somatic components of Wizard spells even if you are wielding a weapon in both hands.

This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

### Arcane Regeneration

Beginning at 6th level, as a bonus action you may expend a Wizard spell slot to regain hit points equal to 1d8 per level of the spell slot you expended. You must then finish a short or long rest to use this ability again.

### Arcane Blade

Starting at 10th level, you can use your magic to enhance your weapon. Your spellblade does an additional 1d8 damage when you hit with a melee attack. This extra damage can be acid, cold, fire,  lightning, or thunder damage, chosen when you bond with your spellblade. At 14th level the additional damage increases to 1d10.

### Mystic Assault

Beginning at 14th level, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn you may use a bonus action to cast a spell with a casting time of one action.

## SEA MAGIC

Not a school in the traditional sense, Sea Wizards (often referred to as Sea Mages) are wizards with situational training much like war wizards. Instead of learning their magic behind a book in a dusty tower, Sea Wizards are merchants, sailors and pirates who have taken to the high seas to hone their craft. You may summon a wind gust to help guide the ship along or foretell a coming storm.

### CHARM OF THE SEA

The first thing a Sea Wizard learns is to create a small charm to help him survive and thrive on the high seas. The charm can be any small worn or carried item such as a piece of driftwood or an idol. The charm grants one ability at 2nd level and an additional ability at 6th, 10th and 14th. You may change type of charm selected after a long rest. The charm bestows its protections on anyone wearing it, but loses its potency at the end of long rest if it is not restored by the Sea Wizard.

Water breathing

Swim Speed of 30 and 60 foot darkvision

The ability to communicate with marine based animals using simple gestures and sounds

Advantage on Acrobatic Checks

### ADDITIONAL FAMILIARS

When casting the Find Familiar spell you may select from the following additional creatures as familiars: Parrot, Monkey, Crab (see Appendix A)

### THE WIND AT YOUR BACK

At 6th level you may use your Intelligence modifier instead of your dexterity modifier for Dexterity saving throws. In addition, when you cast the spell Gust of Wind, you can change the duration to Concentration (up to 1 hour).

### EVASION

Beginning at 10th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### MAN OVERBOARD

At 14th level you may, as an action, summon force bubbles around a number of visible, willing creatures other than yourself equal to your proficiency modifier. Each force bubble has 50 hps, an AC of 8 and contains 1 hour of breathable air. This effect lasts for 1 hour, requires concentration and may not be used again until a long rest is completed. It acts similar to the spell Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere with the above exceptions.

 

## TREEKEEPER

Sacred wizards of the Canolbarth forest, treekeepers are responsible for maintaining the magic of the great forest. Though their powers are arcane, not divine, the elves are often mistaken for druids. Their harmony with nature is so innate they can change theve^ climate around them. While not divine casters, the elves mimic the druids' spells with similar magics created to maintain the Canolbarth forest. Indeed, treekeepers are longtime allies of druids % and the fey that walk the glades of the woods.

Together they protect the elven nation from those that would harm or exploit it.

Treekeepers are most commonly found in Alfheim wandering the trails and walking among the home trees there. Those that follow the path of the treekeeper rarely have any reason to leave their homeland, for it is the source of their power. Though treekeepers are sworn to protect the wood from all threats, some more prescient treekeepers know that there is danger outside of

Alfheim that threatens their homeland. Many elf tribes outside of Alfheim use treekeepers to maintain their forests, learning the secrets from Alfheim wizards. While elven forests outside of Alfheim are far less impressive, the magic of the treekeepers still works. Some treekeepers wander into the human lands, or even into the wild growth timber forests that dot the top of

Rockhome. Treekeepers are often what outsiders think of when they think of elven wizards, a perspective that most elves are happy to maintain.

Restriction: Must be a sylvan elf.

### TREEWALKER

At 2nd level, you ignore difficult terrain while in a forest.

### MAGIC OF THE CANOLBARTH

Treekeepers are often confused with clerics or druids because they can tap into the primordial magic that the Canolbarth forest contains. While you are not a true druid, some of their secrets are revealed to you by the sylvan realm. When you learn new spells for gaining a level, you may substitute one druid spell for one of your wizard spells. Only treekeepers can learn druid spells this way; they cannot be taught to other wizards, not even other Treekeepers.

### WISE IN THE OLD WAYS

At 6th level, you gain advantage on all Animal Handling, Nature and Medicine skill checks. You learn the Sylvan language.

### PROTECTOR OF THE WOODS

You are starting to become one with the forest. Now when you focus, you can see what the trees can see and have learned to harmonize your magic to avoid hurting the trees and other plants native to the Canolbarth. At 10th level, you can see through trees as if they were not there and can cast a spell without harming plants if they are caught in an area of effect spell.

You can cast spells as if trees were not in the way.

### ONE WITH NATURE

You can speak to the flora and the fauna as if they were just another person. You have also learned to move through the forest effortlessly with only the force of your will. At 14th level, you can cast speak with animal or plant without using a spell slot. You can cast tree stride a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier per day.

## OPTIONAL WIZARD FEATURES

Not all wizards concern themselves solely with scholastic matters. Some take an interdisciplinary approach to combat, forgoing certain magical studies to train extensively with martial weapons.

### ARCANE WEAPON TRAINING

Alternate Class Feature (Cantrips class feature)

You know only one cantrip of your choice from the wizard list at 1st level, and do not gain additional cantrips at 4th and 10th level.

Choose three one-handed martial weapons. You gain proficiency in these weapons, and they function as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
