## Common Poisons

While some poisons require exotic or expensive ingredients (see the Maladies chapter in Trials & Treasures), many effective concoctions can be obtained or made with little effort. The following poisons may be commonly available from apothe¬caries and herbalists, at the Narrator’s discretion.

Applying a poison takes an action. A creature immune to the poisoned condition is immune to any effects from poisons.

**Curare.** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon, or up to three pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or is stunned until the end of its next turn.

**Ether.** You can use the chemicals in this flask to soak a rag or other small cloth item. An open flask of ether or an ether-soaked rag retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with it. While you are grappling a creature, you may make a special melee weapon attack against it using ether. On a hit, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. The creature remains unconscious for 1 minute, until it takes damage, or until an action is used to shake or slap the creature awake.

**Poison.** You can use the poison in these vials to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition.

**Basic:** When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or takes 2d4 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of your next turn.

**Advanced:** When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of your next turn.

**Potent:** When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of your next turn.
