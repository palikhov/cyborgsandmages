Fine clothes are the type typically worn by the wealthy class: nobles, prosperous merchants, and important clergy.

**Clothes, Peasant.** These garments might once have been common clothes, but they are now old, threadbare, and out of style. Alternately, peasant clothes can be newly-made of poor materials using crude techniques. Whatever their makeup, peasant clothes mark the wearer as a person of little means.

Traveler’s clothes are like common clothes but made for traveling; cloaks are warmer and hooded, boots are higher and water-resistant, and mittens or gloves are included.  This set of clothes could consist of boots, a wool skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.

## Outfits

Расширен перечень одежды за счет позиций из 3.5 редакции.

**Adventurer's Outfit.** This is a full set of clothes for someone who needs to be prepared for anything. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. A leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt or leggings as an alternative. The clothes will have plenty of pockets. The outfit also includes any extra items you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.

**Artisan / Craftsman Clothes.** Clothes suited to the daily work of a skilled laborer. A shirt, pants or a skirt, sturdy footwear, and possibly a cap or kerchief. A cloth or leather apron, as appropriate for the craft, is included.

**Clerical Vestments.** These are the ceremonial robes and accessories associated with religious ceremony. These are not well-suited to adventuring. Does not include a holy symbol or any other expected religious paraphernalia. A High Priest's vestments may be more akin to a Noble's or Royal Outfit, depending on the practices of the faith.

**Common Outfit.** Basic clothing for a given region or setting. A typical example would be a top (a tunic, a shirt, and vest), leg wear (leggings, pants, a kilt or skirt), a belt or braces (suspenders), and footwear (low boots or shoes). Cloaks and specialty gear are not included

**Courtier's Outfit.** This outfit includes fancy tailored clothes in whatever fashion happens to be the current style in the noble courts. This does not include jewelry appropriate to the class and setting (50 gp worth, minimum).

**Entertainer's Outfit.** This is a set of flashy, perhaps even gaudy, clothes worn by professional entertainers. The specific style and cut depends on customs and the type of performance (musician, dancer, acrobat, jester, etc,), but the practical design allows for ease of movement, allowing performances or just run (if the audience turns ugly). The sleeves will have pockets large enough to hold a bird, coins, or small balls to allow slight-of-hand tricks. Most will include a cap of some manner.

**Explorer's Outfit.** This is a full set of clothes for someone who never knows what to expect. Is includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn instead over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra items you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.

**Monk's Outfit.** This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches, and a loose shirt, and is all bound together with sashes. Though it looks casual, the outfit is designed to give you maximum mobility, and it's made of high-quality fabric. You can hide small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes. Depending on your style, the outfit may be decorated with designs that indicate your lineage or philosophical outlook.

**Noble’s Outfit.** This set of Quality clothes is designed specifically to be expensive and shown off. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing. To truly be complete, the would-be noble also needs a signet ring or emblem and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp).

**Peasant Outfit.** The clothes of the commoner, as befits the setting. Clothes of a typical setting would include a loose shirt and baggy breeches, a loose shirt and skirt, or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes, if at all.

**Royal Outfit.** This is just the clothing, not the scepter, crown, ring, or other symbols of authority or position. Royal clothes are always of Quality – and often ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and furs in abundance.

**Scholar's Outfit (Robes).** The standard dress for a scholar, but also popular among Magic-Users. This outfit includes a robe, belt, cap, soft shoes, and a cloak. Pockets and/or folds in the robe provide places to stash small tools and implements for magic. Pants are recommended.

**Spelunker’s Outfit.** This outfit is for adventurers planning to travel underground. It consists of waterresistant wool breeches, low sturdy boots, wool shirt, leather coat, belt, plain buckle, bandoleer (for attaching equipment), kneepads, elbow pads, and miner's cap.

**Traveler’s outfit.**

## Improved Clothes

Спецальные предметы одежды обладающие дополнительными свойствами или защищающими от каких либо эффектов.

**Aba.** This desert robe is made of lightweight fabric and covers the entire body. Typical colors include brown, gold, black, and white. Elaborate embroidery, made of brightly colored cloth strips or gold thread, often decorates the hem. A silken or cotton sash ties the aba at the waist. In deserts and other dry climates, such garments help prevent evaporation, allowing the wearer to retain more moisture and function more comfortably. Assuming adequate water, a character wearing a desert robe is no more likely to suffer heat exhaustion on days of extreme heat than a normal person would on days of moderate temperatures. Note that desert robes don't help in areas of high humidity; in humid environments, as much skin should be exposed as possible to encourage cooling from the evaporation of perspiration.

**Arctic Coat.** Designed for protection against extreme cold, the arctic coat is a knee-length single-piece garment with a billowing hood. The long sleeves allow the wearer to warm his hands by drawing them inside and holding them against his chest. Arctic coats are usually made of thick bear fur, lined with seal skin for comfort. An arctic coat keeps the wearer comfortable in temperatures well below zero degrees F.

**Bodysuit, Black.** This very tight-fitting garment is made of black silk. It is used by rogues and infiltrators when sneaking around at night. Wearing the suit grants a +2 bonus on Stealth checks in conditions dark enough to grant one-half concealment or better. However, the bodysuit provides no benefit if you wear other clothing or armor, other than belts, pouches, or bandoleers, on top of it.

**Clothes, Camouflage.** Camouflage is the practice of manipulating the visual cues that allow the eye to perceive variations in the environment. These variations are the ones that signal the presence of something out- of-place. Discordant colors and shapes particularly draw the eye; camouflage seeks to mute these effects to maintain concealment. Camouflage clothing is designed to avoid detection, but it applies only in environments the clothing is patterned for. For example, forest-colored camouflage clothing has no benefit in snowy or desert environments. These camouflage rules apply generally to various camouflage methods. When you would suffer disadvantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check because background conditions). The exact application of this effect is left to the Game  Master’s discretion, particularly the question of whether the camouflage sufficiently matches the environment and covers enough of the hiding character to be effective. he forest pattern has a mix of greens, browns, and blacks that provides its bonus in forest and marsh terrains. The desert pattern consists of dark and light tans with irregular black or blue shapes that provides its bonus in desert and plains terrains. The mountain pattern consists of a white background with black, gray, and green shapes and provides its bonus in hills, mountains, and underground terrains. The listed price for camouflage clothes is for one set suited to a specific terrain (see the terrain types).

**Clothes, Cold Weather (Elven).** Cost: 100 gp Weight: 2 lb.

**Clothes, Cold Weather.** A wool coat, linen shirt, wool cap, heavy cloak, thick pants or skirt, and boots. These clothes provide protection from harsh winter weather and cold environments. The wearer can typically operate unhindered in cold climes for longer and with less environmental detriments than someone could while wearing lighter clothing. These clothes provide the benefits of cold weather gear. Other benefits of cold weather clothes

**Clothes, Disguise.** This set of loose clothing is made to be worn over other clothes as a generic disguise. It usually includes clothing that conceals the wearer’s features, like a low-brimmed hat or a hood. A disguise is typically reversible, with one side mimicking the clothing of a beggar and the other appearing to be the clothes of a person from a middling social class, like a modest merchant. To help in evading pursuers, the disguise can be torn away with a single action and either stowed in a pack or abandoned somewhere out of sight.

**Desert Outfit.** This outfit consists of loose, billowy clothing to keep the wearer cool and protected from the sun while in hot, dry desert terrain. It includes a caftan, turban, scarf, loose pantaloons, and sandals or high cloth boots. This outfit counts as light clothing and offers limited protections against some waste hazards. The protection it offers against heat is negated if the wearer also dons armor.

**Fur Clothing.** Fur clothing consists of thick layers of animal furs designed to be worn over a regular set of clothing or armor. Wearing fur clothing grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against exposure to cold weather. Fur clothing can be worn over a cold weather outfit; in this case the circumstance bonuses granted by each item stack, granting a total +10 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against exposure to cold weather. Fur clothing is cumbersome to wear. Although the furs do not provide an appreciable armor bonus, they do increase your total armor check penalty for any armor worn by 2 points.

**Heatsuit Outfit.** Clothing designed to protect the wearer against abysmal heat, such as temperatures found around forges and volcanoes. It consists of heavy pants and coat, a specially treated leather apron, very thick mittens, a thick hood, and goggles. The heatsuit outfit prevents 3 points of normal heat damage per round (not subdual) and eliminates the penalty on saves for wearing heavy clothes. A heatsuit outfit should be worn only for brief periods of time.

**Hydration Suit.** The hydration suit is a masterpiece of water retention, crafted by waste-dwellers with technical skill and unusual materials. Its design allows you to recover nearly all the water your body loses through sweat and exhalation. A hydration suit is made of the skin and tissue of various desert-dwelling beasts and treated with oils or waxes for water retention. It covers your entire body, with a tight-fitting hood over the head and a mask covering the mouth and nose. Inside the mask is a glass plate to collect condensation and a tube fashioned from watertight materials. An inner lining wicks sweat away from your body and collects it in spongelike filtration material that can be removed after you doff the hydration suit. The tube from the facemask twists in loops around your body, through the sponge, to reclaim moisture, condensing it in a reservoir from which you can sip. A functioning hydration suit eliminates the need to make Constitution checks to avoid dehydration. It raises the level of protection from heat dangers by two steps, and its mask functions as a filter mask. A hydration suit offers no protection from magical dessication damage.

**Marshland Outfit.** Marshland outfit includes special boots, gloves, and clothes designed to repel moisture and muck. This outfit can be worn over light armor and takes 5 minutes to don or remove. While you are wearing marshland outfit, you can move at a normal pace through nonmagical swamps and marshes, but you have disad­vantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws made on dry or rocky terrain.

**Oilskin suit.**

**Outfit, Flame-Retardant.** Constructed to resist the effects of hot environments (such as forest fires and areas of volcanic activity), this set of overlapping, heavy leather clothing includes a pair of fire-resistant boots. The outfit grants fire resistance 1, but exposure to fire damage ruins the outfit after 20 rounds.

## Special clothing items

Помимо полных наборов одежды внешний вид персонажей разнообразится также за счет различных дополнительных предметов, а обычные на первый взгляд вещи могут обладать дополнительными свойствами.

**Ammo** **Bandolier****.** This simple leather cross-belt features twelve leather loops suitable for holding bullets or cannon shots, enabling easy access to them. A character can wear up to two bandoliers or braces.

**Armored Coat.** Consisting of a short leather jacket reinforced with hidden metal plates, the protective natur of these jackets can be overlooked. Traditionally, they are fitted with hidden pockets and wrist scabbards that can hold a dagger or other small weapon. This armor can be easily mistaken for normal clothing; any observer must succeed in a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to recognize the true nature of the armor.

**Bandoleer, Masterwork.** This well-crafted bandoleer holds twelve items.

**Bandoleer.** This leather belt has loops or pouches for carrying small items (up to dagger size). It is usually worn across the chest. It holds eight items. Contained objects must each weigh 1 pound or less. Bandoleers are excellent for holding small thrown weapons like darts and daggers. Any number of such weapons can be drawn from the bandoleer in a turn, counting only as a single interaction with the environment. Removing any other types of item from a bandoleer counts as normal, individual interactions with an object.

**Boots, Smuggler’s.** These otherwise normal high boots have hinged heels that swing open to reveal small storage spaces. Each can hold one or two Fine objects, such as a vial of poison. In addition, the inside lining of the boot can be removed to hide thin, flat objects like a map or slender dagger. It requires a successful Investigation check (DC 25) to locate items hidden in the boots.

**Cloak, forester.**

**Crampons.** A crampon is a metal plate with spikes that is strapped to the sole of a boot. A creature wearing crampons can’t fall prone while moving across slippery ice.

**Dueling Cape.** A small one armed cape meant to be worn in lieu of a shield when fighting with a single one-handed weapon. Varying in design and color. +1 to AC. Once per encounter, you can use a reaction to impose disadvantage on a creature making a melee attack against you. You only gain these benefits when wielding a single one-handed weapon.

**Ghillie Suit.**

**Potion Belt, Masterwork.** This extremely well-made potion belt holds ten potions. Retrieving a potion from a potion belt is a free action once per round

**Potion Belt.** This sturdy leather belt similar to a bandoleer has pockets shaped to hold potion vials and is fitted with ties or flaps to keep the potions from falling out. It holds six potions. Retrieving a potion from a potion belt is a free action once per round.

**Rain Poncho.** A one-piece garment resembling a large cloak with a head-sized hole in the center, a poncho helps keep the wearer dry during rain storms. Ponchos are made of canvas or similar material, often treated with a waterproofing oil. A poncho can double as ground cover and can also be used as an emergency tent. Crude ponchos are sometimes woven from grass or reeds.

**Shoes, Silent.** These are soft, padded shoes that absorb sound effectively. Despite the padding, the soles are made from tough, stretchy leather that holds up to abuse. They grant a +1 bonus on Stealth Move Silently checks.

**Snow Goggles.** These wooden goggles have a thin horizontal slit in the middle. They grant a +2 bonus on saves to resist blinding effects, including snow blindness, extremely bright light, or spells that target vision indirectly (such as sunburst but not blindness). While wearing snow goggles, you have disadvantage on Perception checks.

**Snowshoes.** Each about three feet long, these oval-shaped wooden frames are laced with leather webbing to allow' the w’earer to w'alk across snow without sinking. A character newly introduced to wearing snowshoes moves at half his normal rate until he gets used to them. After a day or so of prac¬tice, he moves at his normal rate.

**Sundark Goggles.** Sundark goggles are basically sun glasses. As long as these are worn, creatures with the Sunlight Sensitivity feature lose it. Creatures without Darkvision gain disadvantage for Wisdom (Perception) checks and treat an area of dim light as darkness, while creatures with darkvision treat an area of darkness not as dim light but darkness.

**Vest, Knife.** This specially designed vest is worn over other clothing and can comfortably hold up to ten daggers across the chest.

**Waterproof Boots.** These thick boots are made of tough, water-resilient hide (such as alligator or cari¬bou) treated with a waterproofing oil (typically derived from seals or minks). The wearer tucks his trousers inside the boots, then ties them near the knees with a leather drawstring. The boots keep the feet dry, even when wading in water.

**Wilderness Harness.** This device resembles a thick leather belt with straps that cross over the wearer's back. Both the belt and the straps contain a series of small pouches, useful for storing supplies, ammunition for missile weapons, and cither materials. A secret compartment in the back section of the belt conceals a 6-inch-long flat knife.
