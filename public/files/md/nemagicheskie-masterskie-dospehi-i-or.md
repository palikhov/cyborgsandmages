## SIEGE WEAPONS

![](https://cyborgsandmages.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/siege-weapons.jpg?w=1024)

signed to attack buildings or entire formations of enemy troops, siege weapons do horrific damage if they hit a single person directly (represented r\* the high critical hit multipliers most of these weapons have). Siege ipons inflict critical hits even on creature normally immune to critical ts. Any character hit by a siege weapon is also immediately knocked Mt nct dropping any held items.

Attacks from siege weapons that miss roll for deviation normally. Each weapon rates a standard crew size for the weapon and rounds required to reload.

For each person missing from that crew, the time to reload the weapon is doubled. Siege weapons may be fired, but not reloaded by a single person.

At the company scale, one heavy siege weapon or two light siege weapons form an artillery squad, Add enough additional crewmembers to bring the squad up to 10 members.

### BALLISTA

Essentially a massive, team-served crossbow, ballista attacks take a -1 penalty to attack rolls, and affect the target and all characters in a 20-foot line beyond the target. A critical hit affects only the main target,

### CATAPULT

A relatively simple device using the tension of rope wound around a pole to throw large stones. Catapults take a —5 penalty to attack rolls to hit a target the first rime fired at that target. If the target does nor move (such as a building), each successful attack against that target reduces this penalty by 1 (to a minimum of-1). A successful attack on a target affects not only die target, but a 10 foot by 10 foot square centered on a randomly selected corner of the target s square. A critical hit affects only die main target.

### MANTLETS

Not a weapon so much as a rolling wall slanted to provide protection from ranged weapons. Each mantlet protects a 10-foot-by-10-foot area from ranged attack, providing cover. Each is equivalent to a I-foot thick wooden wall. Mantles have a speed of 5 feet when pushed and cannot run. Two mantlets can protect 1 squad.

### RAM

This is a long heavy pole with a blunt metal head. Successful attacks deal damage to structures like doors and walls. An attack against a moving target takes a -6 circumstance penalty. Heavy rams are suspended inside a protective framework, providing cover against ranged attacks for the crew

### SPRINGDAL

This weapon uses a compressed arm, not unlike that used by a catapult, to launch a huge array of arrows. With its short range and wide area of effect, springdals are more commonly found on ships than used on land. A successful attack on a target affects not only the target, but a 15 foot square centered on the target s square. A critical hit affects all targets in this area. Unlike other siege weapons, this weapon does not knock targeted characters down or cause them to drop held items. This is a light siege weapon for company and army scales.

### TREBUCHET

Though similar in purpose to a catapult — it flings stones —the trebuchet relies on counterweights instead of tension to launch projectiles. These weapons can launch nearly anything that fits in the sling, from old chucks of rock, diseased flesh, or even shadow-filled glass jars that shatter on impact. When used in combat, a trebuchet takes a —4 penalty to hit a target the first time fired at that target If the target does not move (such is a building), each attack against that target (successful or not) reduces his penalty by 1 (to a minimum of O) A successful attack on a target affects not only the target, but also a 10 foot by 10 foot square centered on 1 randomly selected corner of the target's square. A critical hit affects only the main target

## ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT FOR MASS COMBAT

### FIREBOMB

A larger version of alchemists fire, the firebombs deal 2d6 damage on a uect hit, and ld4 to characters caught by the splash

### FLAREBALL

A specialize round for catapults and trebuchet, attacks with this ammunition do no damage, but instead illuminate area at night. 1 he flarcball provides bright light in a 60-foot radius around the target, and shadowy light out to a 120-foot radius. The flareball burns itself out after 15 minutes.

### MEDICAL SUPPLIES

Large stocks of medical supplies improve the ability of healers to deal with casualties from army scale combat (see page 143)\* Each bundle provides the main healer with a +2 circumstance bonus to lus Heal check to reduce casualties. Up to 2 bundles may be used per company the healer attempts to treat.

### MEDICAL TENT

Relatively clean, sheltered spaces with stretchers, worktables, and surgical tools, a medical tent allows healers to reduce the casualties suffered during army scale encounters (see page 143). The healer may roll ld6~l instead of ld4—1 when reducing the number of casualties taken. One tent is required for each company the healer is treating.
