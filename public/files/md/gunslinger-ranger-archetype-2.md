### Gunslinger

Gunslingers use their expertise to hunt and track for coin, using their marksmanship skills to bring down their prey. Some gunslingers work by a personal code that defines what they will or will not do for money, while others have no scruples in who or what they hunt.

### Gunslinger Magic

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gunslinger Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Trick Shot

You can use your firearms to pull off special feats of marksmanship. Trick shots provide special effects or secondary functions to your firearm attacks. Unless otherwise stated, you can use a trick shot as part of the same action you use to attack with the firearm.

You can use only one trick shot each turn. If you are wielding a blunderbuss, you can use only the Deafening Blast and Haft Strike trick shots.

If a trick shot requires a saving throw against its effects, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier. Some trick shots reference weapon options, which can be found in the Adventuring Rules chapter of this book.

Deafening Blast. As your bullet flies toward your target, you can cause one creature you can see within 5 feet of the path of the shot to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is deafened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Disarming Shot. You can use the Disarm weapon option when attacking with a firearm. If the target is beyond the normal range for the weapon, it has advantage on its saving throw. Use your trick shot DC for this saving throw instead of the weapon option DC.

Haft Strike. As a bonus action after you load your firearm, you can whip the weapon around and use the stock to make a melee attack at a target within 5 feet of you. This attack deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage if done with a one-handed firearm, or 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a two-handed firearm, plus your Strength modifier.

Improved Ricochet Shot. You can use the Ricochet Shot weapon option against a target that has total cover, provided you are aware of which space the target occupies.

Manipulate Object. You can fire a round from your gun to manipulate an object at a distance, up to the maximum range of your firearm. This allows you to take the Use an Object action from a distance, though your action is limited to things that can be done with the impact of the bullet, such as punching a button, moving a lever, severing a rope, or similar actions. You can also use this trick shot to move an object weighing no more than 10 pounds, pushing it up to 5 feet away from its original location. If an object is being worn or carried, the creature wearing or carrying it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to prevent the object from being moved.

Shifting Shot. You fire a shot into a space occupied by a Large or smaller creature, near its feet or body. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be compelled to move 5 feet in a direction of your choosing. The creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it would be compelled to move into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit.

### Defensive Tactics

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

Die Hard. When you fail a death saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Fortified Hearing. You are immune to the deafened condition.

Return Fire. When a hostile creature you can see makes a ranged attack against you before your turn (including during the first round of combat), you can make a ranged attack against that enemy as a reaction.

Sudden Withdrawal. When a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can move up to half your speed as a reaction after the damage is dealt. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

### Improved Trick Shot

At 11th level, your impressive marksmanship allows you to perform even greater trick shots with more powerful effects. These improved trick shots require more focus, and you must use an action to perform an improved trick shot.

Disruptive Shot. Make one ranged attack with your firearm. On a hit, if the target is concentrating on a spell, the DC of the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration is equal to 10 or the full damage taken, whichever is higher.

Sharpshooter. Make one ranged attack with your firearm. Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on this attack roll. On a hit, double your damage dice for the attack. If you are firing a blunderbuss, choose one target in range to take the extra damage, rolling normally for the rest.

Stunning Shot. Make one ranged attack with your firearm. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

### Deadeye

Beginning at 15th level, your weapon attacks with firearms score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
