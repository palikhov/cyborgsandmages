**Brutal Strike**

_9th-level barbarian feature_

You can roll an extra 1d4 whenever you deal damage with a melee attack. If you deal this damage while raging, you can move the target of the attack up to 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if it is a Large or smaller creature. This increases to 1d6 at 13th level and 1d8 at 17th level.

17th-level barbarian feature

You lead your people headlong into battle. While you are raging, you and each allied creature within 30 feet of you can't become charmed or frightened.

Instead of making the extra attack from your Frenzied Rage, you can attempt to frighten a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can hear or see you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

**Heroic Renown**

_14th-level fighter feature_

You are a true hero of legend, and your very presence invokes supernatural awe. When you make a Charisma check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

**Lead the Attack**

_17th-level fighter feature_

When you use your Action Surge, choose a creature that can hear or see you within 60 feet of you. That creature can use its reaction to make a single weapon attack or cast a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. The cantrip must require an attack roll or saving throw.

_3rd-level Champion feature_

You deal an additional 1d4 damage when you hit with a weapon attack. This increases to 1d8 at 15th level.

At 20th level, when you have no sorcery points remaining at the beginning of your turn, you regain 3 sorcery points.

The Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin's Wild Magic Surge states that whenever you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you roll a d20 and add the level of the spell to it. On a result greater than 20, a Wild Magic Surge is triggered.

The Tides of Chaos feature states that when you roll a d20 for a Wild Magic Surge and have used your Tides of Chaos, you add an extra +5 to the d20 roll. You regain your use of Tides of Chaos early if you trigger a Wild Magic Surge.

Finally, Bend Luck costs 1 sorcery point, instead of 2.

**Warlock**

Warlocks gain one additional Pact Magic slot at 5th level. Each entry in the Spell Slots column of the Warlock table from 5th level onward is increased by 1.

Warlocks automatically learn their patron's Expended Spell List as warlock spells when their Pact Magic spell slot becomes equal to or greater than the listed spell level. These do not count against a warlock's number of spells known.

The third paragraph of Pact of the Chain is removed and replaced with the following: "Unlike usual familiars, your familiar can attack like a normal creature." A warlock with this pact boon can also choose from the following additional familiar options: cackler (GGR), crawling claw, flumph, gazer (VGM), gray ooze, neogi hatchling (VGM), servitor thrull (GGR), swarm of bats, swarm of insects (any variant), swarm of rats, swarm of ravens, and winged thrull (GGR). The options marked with VGM are from Volo's Guide to Monsters, and the options marked with GGR are from Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica

Pact of the Blade grants you the following additional changes:

1\. You can create or summon your pact weapon once on each of your turns, requiring no action.

2\. While wielding your pact weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus.

3\. When you reach 5th level, you gain the Thirsting Blade invocation. At 12th level, you gain the Life Drinker invocation. These invocations do not count against your number of invocations known, and you cannot replace them when you gain further warlock levels.

**Bottomless Arcana**

_20th-level warlock feature, which replaces Eldritch Master_

At 20th level, you tap into an endless source of magical energy. When you begin your turn and have no spell slots remaining, you gain a 2nd-level spell slot. If not used, this spell slot vanishes when you finish a short or long rest.

The Archfey Otherworldly Patron's Fey Presence lasts for 1 minute. A frightened or charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn to end the effect early.

Any Eldritch Invocation that allows you to cast a spell using a warlock spell slot instead allows you to cast the spell without expending a spell slot.

**Wizard**

**Spell Slinger**

_6th-level School of Evocation feature, which replaces Potent Cantrip_

When you cast a cantrip as an action, you can cast the same cantrip again as a bonus action. You cannot target the same creature with both cantrips.

You regain your expended use of the School of Enchantment's Instinctive Charm when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher.
