I’m one of a **_[wake of attorneys](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk029jLL-eaWgVjeg1FNsDBwjHJ5N3g%3A1603334366686&ei=3vCQX-jFKZy0ytMP876eOA&q=what+is+a+group+of+vultures+called&oq=what+is+a+group+of+vultures+called&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjoECAAQRzoECAAQDToICAAQCBAHEB46CAgAEAgQDRAeUOEUWJIdYMMhaABwA3gAgAFdiAHkBZIBATmYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEFwAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjorIf7lcfsAhUcmnIEHXOfBwcQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)_** that was asked to comment on the recent filing of the above-referenced lawsuit. I’ve spoken my mind but always included my statements with the stereotypical legal caveat that we don’t have all the facts yet. This caveat exists for good reason and is clearly applicable here. All we have is one side of the story, and we don’t have the licensing agreement on which the entire case turns. Ergo, everything at this point is speculation, and I feel that there are enough people commenting that I don’t need to add to the chorus.

That said, there’s one thing that came up in a Twitter conversation that’s important to me, and I felt it was important to expand on it.

> I have no vested interest in [#Dragonlance](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dragonlance?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), not even as a consumer. My concern is that [#WotC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WotC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) has used their ownership of the DL IP to suppress the material rather than market it. That's the opposite of the point of IP. I'd bet good money the authors would publish it if they could.— Rob Bodine, Attorney by Day, #Nerd by Day & Night (@GSLLC) [October 22, 2020](https://twitter.com/GSLLC/status/1319098356698877953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

**_[As I’ve written before](https://gsllcblog.com/2020/09/07/howiplaydnd/)_**, I no longer play D&D, but in my 19 years of playing it, I’ve never played anything in the Dragonlance setting, and I’ve certainly never read one of their novels. (I prefer non-fiction.) This suit has no bearing on my life personally, but certainly does so philosophically.

**Why Do We Have Intellectual Property (“IP”)?**

Many people assume that the goal of IP is to reward the creator, inventor, or producer. That’s incorrect. The reward is the means to achieve the real goal, which is to make sure that the **_public_** — you and I — has access to plenty of art (copyrights) and technology (patents); can instantly know whether they want to purchase particular goods or services based on brand names (trademarks); and have access to lots of other products not otherwise protectable (trade secrets). We assure that goal is reached by giving those creators, inventors, and producers a financial incentive to do what they do by granting them a “limited monopoly” on their endeavors. However, in the end, the point is to serve the public interest. If that interest isn’t being served, why grant the limited monopoly in the first place? There are several exceptions to IP that prove my point, but they’re not relevant here.

**Campaign Settings Gone AWOL**

Wizards of the Coast (“WotC”) owns the rights to several campaign settings that haven’t had anything significant published in years. We know that WotC **_[will be publishing works within three classic campaign settings](https://nerdvanamedia.com/books/classic-dungeons-dragons-settings-return/148332/)_** in the near future, but we don’t know how extensive those efforts will be, or what their nature will be (e.g., novels, campaign settings, living campaigns). However, it’s been a long time coming, and there are still plenty of other campaign settings that **_won’t_** be published soon. How long will we have to wait for those?

When I raised that issue via Twitter, someone with a better sense of their profitability pointed out that **_[it made no financial sense](https://twitter.com/Alphastream/status/1307909651892113408)_** for WotC to publish them. I believe him, and in fact it’s hard not to. After all, WotC isn’t publishing them (or is just getting around to doing so). Obviously, despite their popularity, WotC can’t financially justify producing them. A smaller (yet still competent) company **_could_** do so, but only if WotC’s contract terms aren’t so draconian as to make it unprofitably even for them. To my knowledge, this licensing is open only for novels anyway, so we’re still looking at the suppression of the IP with respect to the actual game where they belong.

**My Philosophical Issue**

The entire point of IP is to get that IP to the public. As steward of these properties, WotC should (not must) get that material to the public. However, the situation effectively uses IP to do the very opposite. The limited monopolies are being used to horde the material, so there’s no legal, viable means through which that material can be marketed to the public. That’s a big problem for me. As I asked above, what’s the point of granting the rights if it means the public won’t get access to the material?

**Wies/Hickman v. WotC**

According to the Complaint, WotC wants to walk away from the deal altogether. If that’s true, then WotC stands to gain nothing from the Dragonlance IP. We’re right back to square one with that property, but the important point is that WotC themselves have nothing to gain from the property, so they have nothing to lose if the property is transferred to Weis and Hickman.

There’s no legal basis of which I’m aware for stripping WotC of their copyrights in these other campaign settings, so I don’t want to see that happen by force. They acquired the property fair and square. However, if WotC is in the wrong here, and this suit gives Weis and Hickman the leverage to take ownership of the Dragonlance IP, WotC breaks even, and everyone else wins. I wouldn’t be upset if that happened. I suspect that if Weis and Hickman did get the license back, then they’d produce a lot more Dragonlance content than WotC ever would. When I suggested that on Twitter, I received this response:

_Infer what you will from that. I did._

_What are the odds of this happening? Probably slim to none, but wouldn’t that be something else?_
