## Vampire Slayer

Vampire slayers wander remote forests, haunted hills, and fog-bound moors, protecting the common folk of farming villages and cabins at the edge of civilized lands from the creatures of the night. Moving unseen through woodlands, your specialized training allows you to hunt vampires, ghouls, werewolves, and other monsters that prey on the innocent. Although you are most at home in the wilderness, as your skills improve, your attention might turn to older vampires that rule entire baronies, or that command dark keeps and sprawling manors closer to civilization.

### Favored Enemy

If you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your favored enemy becomes undead if you did not select undead at 1st level. When you choose additional favored enemies at 6th and 14th level, you can choose freely from the standard list, and you can also select hags or lycanthropes as an alternative.

### Hunter's Prey

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: either Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horde Breaker from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules, or Empowered Strike, which is described below.

Empowered Strike. Your expertise in fighting undead and lycanthropes allows you to harm them even when you're not wielding a magic weapon. When you fight a creature that has [resistance](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat) to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, you can ignore this [resistance](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat) once per turn when you score a hit with a nonmagical weapon. If you are wielding a magic weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage from one of your successful attacks on each of your turns.

### Defensive Tactics

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: either Escape the Horde, Multiattack Defense, or Steel Will from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules, or Ranger's Resilience, which is described below.

**Ranger's Resilience**. You have advantage on saving throws against paralysis and against effects that would reduce your hit point maximum.

### Slayer's Strike

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: either Volley or Whirlwind Attack from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules, or Straight Through the Heart, which is described below.

**Straight Through the Heart**. When you use an attack action, you can choose to make a single [melee attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat) against a favored enemy in an effort to strike a vulnerable spot. If the [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat) hits, it deals an extra 6d6 damage.

### Superior Hunter's Defense

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: either Evasion, Stand Against the Tide, or Uncanny Dodge from the Hunter archetype in the standard rules, or Greater Resilience, which is described below.
