\[E5E\] Palant Notes to Combat – expanded version of original fifth edition rules which are created on small Russian speaking discord community of Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian players.

These extended rules were created after repeated discussions and analysis of the flaws and possible mistakes in the design of the rules of the original 5th edition, as well as thinking about what the game might be missing. Unfortunately, the volume of changed, amended and improved rules, the work and testing of which has been going on since the beginning of 2019, is large enough so that instead of issuing one document of 300-350 pages, we focus on issuing these rules in small editions 3-4 times a month. 10-15 pages in each issue.
