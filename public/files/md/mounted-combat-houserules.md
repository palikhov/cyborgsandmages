## INTELLIGENT CREATURES

 Intelligent creatures are creatures that have a value of Intelligence of 6 or more. If such a creature is used as a mount, it acts independetly and can also attack as one of it's actions, as stated in the official rules. Intelligent creatures are independent creatures. Indeed there can be communication between the creature and it's master, however the creatures acts independently and thus have a turn of their own. This applies to also to riden mounts. These creatures are controlled by the DM. NOTE: The only exception for this rule is the mount from the Find Steed spell. Due to the nature of the spell, that mount is controlled by the PC. Whether intelligent or not, each creature is still a beast at heart. It might disagree with the rider going in a certain direction such as jumping great heights. The DM might ask the PC to make a particular check whether to remain mounted or maybe the creature just runs off. Intelligent creatures might challenge their master more then non-intelligent creatures, especially when the mount is being asked to do something that might hard for it, it considers dangerous or maybe something that it fears. 

## DEATH OF A MOUNT OR COMPANION

 Mounts roll for death saves. A dead mount can be resurrected if the requirements for a ressuraction spell are met. This applies also the companion creatures. Potions Potions and other consumables work as intended even on mounts. But so do the harmful effects of negative potions and poisons. 

## COMPANION NEEDS

 Just like a normal PC, mounts and pets have basic needs. They need: Food and Water to survive Rest after a long day To breathe Someone to take care of them Food and Water is either brought along before the adventure started or else it can be scavanged while in session. Most of the time it will be easy for the mount to be sustained while on an adventure, however some enviroments (such as deserts or frozen landscapes) will make it very hard and might possibly starve your mount. Normal exhaustion rules apply if a mount is not sustained. Food and Water Needs Creature Size Food per Day Water per Day Tiny 1/4 pound 1/4 gallon Small 1 pound 1 gallon Medium 1 pound 1 gallon Large 4 pounds 4 gallons Huge 16 pounds 16 gallons Gargantuan 64 pounds 64 gallons Official Ruling from the D&D Player's Handbook 5e Resting after a long day is a big must if you want your mount to remain healthy. They will suffer normal exhaustion effects if they fail to rest or are being pushed over the limit. Breathing is a rather obvious need. Depending on the nature of the mount, different mounts can breathe in different enviroments and cannot in others. Sometime a PCs has to leave his mount behind if the mount cannot breathe in a certain enviroment he wants to explore. This takes us to the following need. Someone to take care of the mount is needed, especially if the mount is not Intelligent. As discussed before, most of the time the PC has to provide nurishment for his mount. If in danger, the PC needs to protect his mount. Most mounts cannot really fend of for themselves but are a very valuable asset when guided by someone. All of the above applies also for companion creatures. In town, adventurer owned mounts and beasts can be left at the stables were all their needs will be looked after. Stables are discussed in the next chapter. Riding a mount with no saddle No saddle while mounting means that both the beast and the rider and uncomforable. The rider does not have anything that supports him on his mount. Any check done by the PC to remain mounted is done at a disadvantage. Any attack preformed by the PC will be at a disadvantage. While in combat, the rider has to perform a check to remain mounted if the mount moves and the rider does any other action other then try keep steady 

## COMBAT MECHANICS

 In this section we are going to discuss the combat mechanics of a mounted PC and his mount. Mount Actions in Combat A non-intelligent mount can take three different types of actions in combat, while an intelligent one can also take any other actions from its statblock. Dash A mount can take this action to move twice his normal movement speed. Disengage When disengaging a mount can move without triggering attacks of opportunity. (Homebrew) The rider will still provoke an attack of opportunity.\* Dodge The mount can take the dodge action as normal PC or NPCs can. However, only creatures attacking the mount itself will get disadvantage on attack rolls and only the mount will get advantage on Dexterity saving throws. The rider is not affected. Area of Effect on Mounted Creatures When a mounted PC and his mount are inside the Area of Effect of a spell or effect, the rider can be affected too. If HALF the squares that make up the mount's token are inside the are of effect, and that effect affects in a 3D spectrum (not only the ground), then both rider and mount are effected. Ranged Attacks while Mounted Riders doing ranged attacks while mounted will have disadvantage on the attack roll. This also applies to both ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks. 

## ANIMAL HANDLING

 Animal handling is a vital skill when it comes to mounts. A rider needs to be good with animals if it wants to ride one. If a character does not have proficiency in Animal Handling, all rolls related to keeping control of the mount and related will be at a flat DISADVANTAGE, no matter all the other roll modifiers. You still get the +/- modifier related to Animal Handling. Note: A mount summoned by Find STEED does not require proficiency in animal handling since the nature of the spell. 

### Keeping Control of the Mount

 At the start of every turn, a mounted creature has to succeed a DC 10 Animal Handling check. This check is straight forward. If the character has proficiency in Animal Handling then he rolls with advantage. If the character does not have Animal Handling, he rolls with disadvantage. If he fails the Animal Handling check then he must succeed DC 10 Dexterity saving throw (modifiers from saddle's apply) otherwise he will be knocked prone 5ft away from the mount and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The mount will dash as far as possible away from it's rider. That will be the end of the rider's turn. If the rider succeeds the Dexterity saving throw, he will land on his feet 5ft next to the mount. He will still have his turn, but the mount will still be spooked off.

### Melee Reach

 Mounted combat adds a 3 Dimenstional element to combat. Every creature has his own height. If you ride on top of a creature, you are standing on that creauture's back, hench elevated from the ground by that creature's height. Each mount has a height value stated in it's character sheet. That value is the distance the rider is standing above the ground when riding the said mount. Mounted character melee weapon without "REACH" attribute: Mount Size Cannot hit Medium - None Large - Tiny or smaller Huge - Medium or smaller Gargantum - Large or smaller Mounted character melee weapon with "REACH" attribute: Mount Size Cannot hit Medium - None Large - None Huge - Medium or smaller Gargantum - Large or smaller Note: These melee range restrictions also apply when a creature of the stated size wants to attack the rider who is standing on a mount. For example a medium or smaller sized creature, wielding a melee weapon without the 'Reach' attribute, cannot hit the rider of a Huge or bigger mount.
