Elturel - это большой, упорядоченный город, сто­ящий на реке Чионтар и заполненный купцами, реч­ными торговцами и фермерами, привезшими свой урожай на продажу. Главная достопримечательность города - огромный шар магического света, осве­щающий его улицы и окрестности днём и ночью. Его свет болезненный для нежити и виден почти из каждого уголка Элтургарда \[Elturgard\] (столицей которого является Элтурель) как свет восходящего солнца или далёкой, но яркой звезды.

Geography

The city was situated atop a cliff, dominating the River Chionthar. After the Spellplague, a small pocket of plagueland appeared a few miles south of the city.

The city itself was split into two districts: the High District and the Dock District.

The capital city of Elturgard, Elturel is a powerful city defended by an impressive force of paladins and bathed in the constant light of a massive glowing orb which harms any undead who strays within its rays. It also makes getting to sleep at night much harder than normal. People there have thick curtains.

Elturgard's Companions, powerful paladin defenders, are the match of any Flaming Fist veteran or Knight in Silver, but their limited numbers make them a lesser military force than Baldur's Gate or Silverymoon, even supplemented as they are by the Hellrider cavalry and the Elturel Guard infantry. Even so, their might is sufficient to defend Elturgard from her numerous surrounding enemies: The yuan-ti of Najara just to the north, the lycanthropes of the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the west, gnolls from the Reaching Woods nestled on the east, and the ogres and more gnolls in the Sunset Mountains slightly further east.

Elturel is a theocracy run by the High Overseer of Torm. This makes toppling it from within very difficult, as getting promoted up through the Torm theocracy. Elturgard has no significant internal rifts and their primary trading partners are the immensely powerful Baldur's Gate and Cormyr. As such, finding a military proxy with which to conquer Elturgard is easily the best option for adding it to the sphere of influence. An alliance between the gnolls, ogres, and lycanthropes would have a fair chance if organized by effective leaders. An alliance of convenience with Najara isn't out of the question, for while Najara would never accept non-snake sovereignty over their territory, they might be convinced to help nonsnakes capture Elturgard simply to get rid of Elturgard as a potential threat.

A brief visit is made to Elturel in Hoard of the Dragon Queen, but more importantly, Elturgard is a psuedo-capital of the Order of the Gauntlet, which means any material on said Order can be applied more or less to Elturgard.

Elturel was the farming center of the Fields of the Dead and thrived on the trade the passed through its domain.\[4\] Traders greatly appreciated the protection afforded to them by the city's Hellriders.\[1\] After the founding of Elturgard, the officials who handled trade in the city became overly righteous and handed exorbitant taxes and punishments to traders who demonstrated even the slightest impiety.\[2\]

Defenses

Elturel's main defense for much of its existence were the mounted warriors known as the Hellriders. Though they numbered only 2,000, they were not only the guards and police of the city, they also effectively patrolled the River Chionthar and surrounding roads. After the Spellplague, Elturel was the home of many paladins, who ably protected the city from the forces of evil and plaguechanged creatures coming from the south. A shining orb known as the Companion hung over the city although only the High Observer truly knew if this was truly a blessing of Amaunator.\[2\] The orb produced light that was painful to undead, and could be seen from virtually anywhere within Elturgard.\[5\]

Government

Elturel has only ever been noted as having a single, absolute ruler. The city was ruled by the High Observer of Torm who made certain that the city was run efficiently and that the area surrounding the city remained safe.\[2\]

Independent City

Who Rules: High Rider Lord Dhelt (LG hm Pal(of Helm)16), a tolerant and re¬spected man who keeps his city part of the Lords' Alliance (see Baldur's Gate, above).

Who Really Rules: Lord Dhelt's rule is unquestioned, and considered both fair and just. He takes a light hand in daily af¬fairs, leaving the merchants of Elturel freedom to operate within the large boundaries he permits.

Population: 26,778 (registered); real population averages 29,000 in winter and about 33,000 in summer, not including the farmers of the Fields of the Dead, who crowd into the city in times of war. The many warehouses and cellars of the city (hewn out of solid rock beneath the houses of the High District) allow Elturel to briefly hold upward of 400,000 folk, if plague or an orc horde comes down on the land.

Major Products: Leatherwork, live¬stock (meat, cheese), wool, and glues (rendered from the hooves and horns of livestock).

Armed Forces: The Hellriders, consist¬ing of skilled horsemen armed with spears, composite bows (they can fire from the saddles of their moving mounts without penalty), and long, curved sabres (treat as scimitars) are usually 2,000 strong. They guard and police the city, even patrolling the river nearby by means of four rowing-barges, and protect the lands around with their famous mounted patrols.

A patrol is typically 30 strong. Fresh mounts are kept at guardhouses through¬out the Fields of the Dead, and a patrol passes a given point on the roads about every four hours, every day and night around. Warning beacons have been set up all across the farmlands north, east, and west of Elturel, and watchers on the roofwalks of High Hall are always on duty, peering over the lands below in search of approaching Hellriders or the light and smoke of a lit beacon.

Notable Mages:

• Baranta Chansil (CG hf W14), a di-minutive, bright little whirlwind of en¬ergy and enthusiasm, whose name is often linked romantically with that of Lord Dhelt, by watchful and wistful citizens.

• Orsar "Greencloak" (NG hem W(T)15), a close-mouthed recluse con¬cerned with making and perfecting spells, items, and potions concerned with flight. He is a secret friend of Lord Dhelt, and serves the lord as a spy within the city; unbeknownst to most of his fellow citi¬zens, he spends much time slipping about cloaked in magical invisibility while in wraithform. He makes his living selling the potions he makes. There is a 1 in 10 chance that Orsar will have 2-5 potions of any particular type requested on hand (though at phenomenal prices).

Notable Churches:

• Helm's Shieldhall, temple of Helm; High Watcher Berelduin Shondar (LN hm P18), "Bereld the Just," a stern and warlike patriarch who leads Hellrider patrols as often as Lord Dhelt does; 21 priests, 85 followers.

• The High Harvest Home, temple of Chauntea; High Priest and Harvestmaster Raulauvin Oregh (NG hm P20); 18 priests, 42 followers.

• Shrines to Ilmater, Tempus, Tymora, Waukeen.

Notable Rogues' and Thieves' Guilds:

The only such organization Lord Dhelt al¬lows is the High Moor Heroes' Guild, a band of adventurers who regularly lead "scouring" expeditions up onto the High Moor. The guild members tutor other ad¬venturers for fees (discounts to fellow guildmembers) and provide a legitimate outlet for the lawless, violent, penniless and other misfits of Elturel.

Equipment Shops: Partial.

Adventurers' Quarters  
The better inns of Elturel are converted houses (often sev¬eral adjacent houses, linked together) in the High District. The noisier, simpler ac¬comodations of the Dock District are of¬ten the only places a bed can be found on summer nights when trade is at its height. By Lord Dhelt's decree, inns cannot serve drinks, neither can inns and taverns be under the same roof. In the High Dis¬trict:  
• Hondakar's House, a large inn in the heart of the High District (excellent/ expensive);  
• Symbril's House, a small, cozy inn near Maidens' Leap in the High District, overlooking (and opening into) the Gar¬den (excellent/ moderate).  
In the Dock District:  
• Phontyr's Unicorn, a converted former factory, which is ramshackle, ec¬centric, and friendly, the scene of shady deals and much late-night business (good/cheap);  
• Gallowglar's Inn, a warm but well- worn, low-beamed place that sprawls  
amid the aromatic stockyards (fair/ moderate);  
• The Oar and Wagonwheel Inn, a rau¬cous, drafty barn of a place, always crowded and never quiet (poor/cheap).  
• The best-known of Elturel's taverns is A Pair of Black Antlers, a dimly-lit, wood-panelled place adorned with a pair of stag's antlers fully 20 feet across, and many adventurers' relics and parapher¬nalia.  
• Also popular among louder carousers is The Bent Helm, a dockside establish¬ment favored by smugglers and other shady sorts, and often visited by 20- strong Hellrider foot patrols, called in to quell yet another brawl.  
Important Characters:  
• Dathlyr "the Hammer" Greybold (LG dm F8), an adventurer active in exploring the ruins of The Fallen Kingdom, from which he has gleaned many treasures.  
• Folehar Flametree (CN half-m F6/T7), an adventurer and merchant often chided by Lord Dhelt when his smuggling activi¬ties anger authorities in Amn, Baldur's Gate, Iriaebor and Waterdeep. He deals in rare and unique goods, such as magic plundered from tombs, gems stolen from royal treasuries, kidnapped heirs and heiresses, and the like.  
• Mither Mandaroze (CN hm T6), a fat, jovial weapons outfitter and fence of stolen goods.  
• Shandeir (CG hf W16), a sharp- tongued, spirited adventuring mage known for salty jokes, pranks, and for riding a friendly copper dragon about, when she travels.  
Important Features in Town  
Situated on a rising, defensible hill that falls away in a rocky cliff on its south side where the Chionthar flows, the High District of Elturel dominates the untidy, noisome Dock District below, which is dominated by warehouses, markets, wagonmakers, and large stockyards. A Dragoneye Deal¬ing Coster way-base is located in the Dock District and many other caravan- related concerns also have yards, or at least offices, there.  
The Dock District is all dirt, business, and utilitarian buildings, but the High District is built of stone. Its narrow, twist¬ing, steep, cobbled streets are crowded with spired and balcony-festooned tall, narrow houses, dominated by the spires of High Hall, residence of the High Rider, and seat of local government and all large commercial meetings.  
Stretching away from High Hall in a narrow cut amid the buildings, "like the blade of a naked sword," as Elminster put it, lies the long, narrow Garden. It is an open place of flowers, wooded paths, arched bridges, and a spring that rises un¬der High Hall (ensuring the city a supply of fresh water), and winds the length of the Garden, to tumble down the hill in the cascades of Maidens' Leap, and thence by canal to form a moat and bargeway for the eastern Dock District, ere it joins the Chionthar.  
The Garden is a favorite meeting place for citizens of Elturel, and retains a wild beauty in winter (local songs and tales of¬ten call it "the Winter Garden").  
A stout stone wall encircles the city, pierced by two gates, and open on the river side.  
Local Lore: Elturel is a trading city where river travel on the Chionthar meets overland trade. It is also the local market for the rich farming lands of The Fields of the Dead and the fertile banks of the lower Chionthar, where thousands of sheep and cattle are gathered each year for transport to the markets far across Faerun.  
Of old, Elturel was one of the few defensible spots in the great rolling lands from the Sword Coast to the vast woodlands of the Meet, where the River Reaching joins the Chionthar. Once a troll lord had a stronghold on the heights here. Later an ogre chieftan drove out the trolls and held the lands around from a crude stone for¬tress on the site. In the days when men had come but trolls, ogres, and the like still roamed the region, a human castle stood here, changing hands from lordling to lordling, but serving always as a refuge for humans against the dangers of the lands around. Brigands are the chief danger to¬day, although orcs, trolls, ogres and such still come raiding from the mist- cloaked High Moor to despoil the rich farms of The Fields of the Dead. The great battles which gave that region its name may be past now, but the men of Elturel still keep their arms, patrolling the farms which look to them for protection. "The Riders of Elturel" have galloped out of the night to save many a farmer from trolls or worse, and are famous in song. High Rider Lord Dhelt still leads his share of patrols— and all big sorties, when trouble is met —into the lands around, and is widely respected as a just, no-nonsense ruler.

The Bent Helm  
Tavern  
This dockside tavern is Elturels rowdiest dive. It is a brawling pit visited by those who like to get  
thoroughly drunk and then have a good fight. Its signboard is visible from afar: a brightly polished, gigantic war helm hanging from a spar on a stout chain. The helm was worn by a giant in a long-ago battle just north of Elturel. It is bent halfway up at a sharp angle to the right as a result of a leaping dwarf  
kings axe. The death of the giant was the other result. The helm now serves as a beacon for brawlers from all over the city, as well as visiting adventurers and caravan guards. Dont come here if you want to relax, enjoy some minstrelry or quiet, or conduct a little business in peace. All the flying tankards make it hard to concentrate  
The Place  
Imagine a large open barn without a loft, its hammerbeam ceiling exposed. Add a few driftglobes (which are fixed in place, well aloft, and serve to heat the tavern as well as light it), a flagstone floor, and rusty metal claddingmainly made of old shields, hammered flaton all walls and pillars, that continues as high up as possible. Put a bar at one end, staff it with burly, hairy-armed warriors who can throw hard and accurately, equip them a few hand crossbows and sleep-envenomed bolts to quell major problems, and fit each roof pillar with elbow-height surround tables for holding drinks. Fill the place with thirsty patrons, serve potent ale, stout, and sherry in easily broken earthenware tankards to cut down on  
fatalities, and stand back and watch the fights.  
The Prospect  
The Helm has a no-weapons rule.  
Patrons are invited to check weapons at the door by a curvaceous lass who wears a differentbut always wildly daringcostume each night. Two firm but friendly ettins armed with clubs turn away anyone who refuses to surrender obvious weapons. Theyre backed up by the doorclerk. Shes a mage of minor power who keeps a wand of paralyzation handy. Despite these precautions, stabbings at the Helm are frequent, and the local shrine to Tempus (the Hand That Swings the Sword) directs any visiting priests of the war god in need of funds to spend some time in this taverns back room, healing the wounded. Typical fees are 1,000 gp per spell applied.  
The Provender and the Prices  
All drinks are 2 cp per tankard, and no food is available. Available drinks include undistinguished light and dark ales, a stout with a very robust character, and ample quantities of rough, strong sherry. Pouches of pipe tobacco are 6 cp each. Lightsfrom tapers reached across the barare free.  
A Pair of Black Antlers  
Tavern  
properly), this cozy place is a maze of stone support pillars, low, massive overhead beams, and dark, massive furniture salvaged from old villas and castles. If things are too dark to see an interesting-looking map or missive, This tavern stands on the west side of one of three blue-hued driftglobes can Maidensbridge Street, just south of be called forbut this will draw the where it swings westward to cross the attentive eyes of many patrons in the bridge it is named for and run around the northern end of the central heights of the city to link up with Westerly. Outside the city, A Pair of Black Antlers is the best known of Elturels taverns because its the gathering place for those who seek adventure. Old, retired warriors, young and bright-eyed would-bes, and weary adventurers alike all come here. labyrinthine, many-leveled taproom.  
The Prospect  
The walls of A Pair of Black Antlers are decorated over the bar with a truly gigantic rack of antlers. I climbed up on the baras many others have done beforeto measure them, marveling. Theyre fully 20 feet across! The walls are also dotted with the relics and trophies of many adventurers: old, notched and scarred weapons; split shields; the heads, tails, and claws of sundry shocked-looking, dusty, longdead monsters; and fading maps, bloodstained and covered with angry error-correcting scribbles, of old castle dungeons, dwarven holds, tombs, and other subterranean complexes that presumably once held rich treasures. (Some of these maps may well be palpable forgeries.) No adventurers visit to Elturel is complete without a stop at the Antlers. Many adventures have begun in its taproomand many more likely will. The Antlers is the place to hear gossip about adventuring, join a band, hire swordswingers for a plan of your own, or get hired to carry out another dreamers plan. Need a curse lifted or some other spell cast? The patrons here will know who to call on and where they can be found, for the price of a tankard. Want to hear tales that chill the blood or splendid songs of daring deeds? This is the place. Want to impress a likely looking young blade of the other sex? Bewaresome of them may be dopplegangers or shapeshifting magesbut then, you wanted adventure. . . .  
The Provender  
The Place  
Wood-paneled, dimly lit, and apt to be smoky (the fireplace doesnt draw The heartily cheerful staff of the Antlers are all ex-adventurers of a great variety of ages, races, and appearances. They pour out drinks with generous handsno one need feel slighted here. One can also purchase salted biscuits,  
slabs of sharp-tasting onion cheese, river clams, and gurdats (pan-fried, pepper-spiced mushrooms in a melted cheese batter).  
The Prices  
Ale is 3 cp per tankard (large, battered pewter reservoirs) or 7 cp per hand keg, stout is 5 cp per tankard, and wine starts at 6 cp per tallglass and rises to 9 cp a glass for the best vintages. Sherries, zzar, and brandies are all 1 sp per tallglass. Elverquisst, the most expensive drink in the house, is 4 gp per tallglass.  
All servings of provender are 6 cp a plate, which provides a light meal. Two plates would serve as a nice repast.  
Travelers Lore  
The Antlers has about as many hidden treasure legends as any drinking house associated with adventurers.  
The patrons have adopted one bardic ballad (given following) as their favorite drinking song. This song is a nightly favorite at the Antlers. Woe befall any minstrel who shows up to play without a sensitive mastery of itthe ability to sing and play it with mournful, macabre skill. Its a bardic standard, but here it has the revered status of an anthem to fallen com  
This verse has been outlawed in Elturel, because some fiendishly evil archmage of the city wove a summoning spell into the words that swiftly brought undead to whoever sang them. Theyre still whispered across many a dying campfire in the Realms by those brave (or foolish) enough to  
risk the coming of seven skeletal warriors riding as many skeletal horses or whatever lesser undead show up instead.3 3Elminster can sing, but cant write down tunes as we do. He says this ballad is usually chanted to a dark, intricate harp melody in Faerßnbut it can be sung to a quite different melody: the tune of the traditional Celtic song  
of our world, Down by the Sally  
Gallowgars Inn  
Inn  
This ramshackle, well-worn inn  
sprawls in all directions in the midst  
of Elturels dockside stockyards, looking just like the spider web of clumsily linked buildings that it is. Well  
known for its affable host, Guldin Gallowgar, its also known as the Manure  
Pile to folk of delicate noses whove  
had to stay there in hot summer  
weather.  
The Place  
Gallowgars Inn is an aromatic assembly of mismatched warehouses. Its  
warm and dimly lit inside, even  
cozybut the furnishings are simple,  
the fare even more so, and the stench  
of well-rotted cow dung permeates  
everything.  
The Prospect  
Gallowgars Inn is famous because of  
its host, a retired adventurer of  
mature years who seems to know  
everyone and everything in the Coast  
lands and to have a finger, or at least  
an investment, in almost every trading or shipping company mentioned  
in this guide! Guldin Gallowgar dishes  
out advice on where to locate almost  
anyone or anything, and is known to  
sponsor caravans and adventuring  
bands.  
The Provender  
Food doesnt have to be spectacular  
when everything smells of manure  
but Gallowgar himself thrives on what  
99  
he feeds guests: slabs of salty bread,  
wedges of sharp-spiced local cheese,  
plates of river minnows fried in eggs  
and seasoned with a hint of tansy and  
a scant handful of crushed wayflowers, and portions of stew ladled from  
three salt stew pots. One pot contains  
hare, one trout, and one shrimps and  
clams brought up the River Chionthar  
by barge.  
The Prices  
Mead is 1 sp per flagon, and ale is 6  
cp per tankard. All platters and stew  
bowls are 5 gp, but this includes two  
tallglasses or tankards. Rooms are 4  
to 10 gp per night, varying by size and  
location. Most are 6 gp. They include  
hot baths and stabling.  
Travelers Lore  
Gallowgars is a favored destination  
by those whose coins are fewespecially if theyre involved with caravans  
or are adventurers. His sponsorship  
of an adventuring group is said to  
cost a percentage of what treasure it  
might find. Rumor reports his wealth  
as staggering, but theres no sigh of it  
about his inn at least. There are whispers hes married to the haughtiest of  
Elturels nobility, an apparently unattached lady of decadent tastes and  
endless parties whose tall-turreted  
home overlooks the citys gardens.  
It is certain that Guldin can get  
from place to, place swiftly and often  
unseen, and that he does know an  
astonishing number of folkin many  
cities, and from all walks of life. Many  
guests come to stay just to question  
him or to chat.  
Phontyrs Unicorn  
Inn  
This famous inn is named for the ally,  
lifelong friend, and possible love of  
the long-dead mage Phontyr Wonderspella glowing unicorn whose  
hooves never touch the ground. Some  
say the seldom-seen unicorn is a  
manifestation of the goddess Mielikki.  
Others swear she is a polymorphed  
sorceress that Phontyr loved who is  
trapped forever in unicorn form  
Phontyr could not free her from  
magic greater than his own. Still  
others say it is Lurue or Silverymoon,  
the Divine Beast. Cult of the Unicorn  
members bought the inn to be near  
the unicorn. They typically fall on  
their knees and chant with adoration  
when it is seen.  
The Place  
Phontyrs Unicorn is a splendid establishment of deep green carpets, ferns  
in hanging baskets, dim lighting from  
strategically placed glowing globes,  
and curtained, canopied beds. The  
inns adornments celebrate the  
famous unicorn in many carvings,  
painted shields, and tapestries. Quite  
a few of these images are enchanted  
so as to glow blue-white, just as the  
real unicorn does.  
The inn has a wine cellar as good  
as any to be found in Waterdeep (for  
comparable prices, too), several  
lounges and meeting rooms for the  
use of guests, and a fine dining room.  
Dry white house wine, sliced cheese,  
and salted biscuits are always at hand  
on trays everywhere about, free for  
the taking. Rooms are spacious, draftfree, and quiet thanks to the tapestries that hang everywhere. These are  
deep green like the carpets, and each  
is adorned with the glowing bluewhite head of a watchful unicorn.  
Eager, soft-spoken, thoughtful  
human staff members of both sexes  
dressed in green unicorn-adorned  
livery move quietly about the inn, seeing to every need of the guests. They  
even play board games or cards with  
bored or lonely patrons, though not  
for money.  
The Prospect  
Whatever the unicorns true nature  
may be, the recently improved inn  
stands on the site of Phontyrs house,  
which burned down under mysterious circumstances after the archmages death. The unicorn is seen on  
misty nights in or near the inn, prancing about and then galloping away in  
eerie silence. Legend says that those  
who follow it and can keep it in sight  
will be led to rich treasure. Not surprisingly, the inn has become a  
favorite haunt of novice adventurers,  
who hang about each night with  
ready-saddled horses or magical  
means of flight, hoping the unicorn  
will appear.  
The Provender  
Food at the Unicorn consists of all the  
usual gravy-drenched roasts and fried  
root vegetables, plus a few notable  
dishes, soups prominent among  
them. For conservative tastes, theres  
boar hock soup. Those who look  
100  
upon their stomachs as trusted  
friends will enjoy the cold potato-andleek soup and the hot pheasant tail  
soup. This last soup is an Elturian  
favorite, and is named for the three  
pheasant feathers stood up as decoration beside each bowl. Its actually a  
thick simmered stock of what small  
game fowl that can be had and, in  
establishments less honest than this  
one, small rodents.  
The soups are served before heavier main dishes. The cooks at the  
Unicorn excel at shark steaks fried  
in seed oil, and at roast boar with all  
the trimmings. The delicious shade  
of brown that they manage to cook  
the outside of the well-seasoned  
roasts to is enough to set ones  
mouth to watering.  
Travelers Lore  
The Unicorn has at least 20 unicorn  
sightings a year, and a few adventurers fast and lucky enough to follow  
the ethereally beautiful creature  
have become very rich. Two bands  
were led to hitherto unknown, abandoned dwarven holds near the city  
and found stockpiles of gold, silver,  
and fine ores, and another group lit  
erally fell into an ancient mages  
tomb in the woods!  
Dungeon of the Inquisitor  
Those who trespass against the laws of Elturgard three times are thrown into the Dungeon of the Inquisitor.This vast, subterranean maze lies deep beneath the  
streets of Elturel, and its population is constantly being replenished by new lawbreakers. Parts of the dungeon consist of natural caverns discovered during the excavation, and their full extents and final destinations have yet to be determined. Strange  
sounds infrequently echo from unknown cavities –  
sometimes rushing water is heard, other times the  
enraged roars of vicious behemoths ring out. From  
time to time, dungeon prisoners on mining detail  
escape their captors and dash into unexplored  
crevices and tunnels They are never seen again, on or  
below Faerû  
Elturgard is a relatively small island  
of order and hope in an inhospitable swath of the  
Western Heartlands. Over the years, hundreds of  
people fleeing a mummy’s curse, a vampire’s service,  
or some other undead involvement have arrived here,  
settling in Elturel in particular. The forests  
surrounding this land have grown wild and  
dangerous.  
A pocket of plagueland festering several miles to  
the south has a habit of spewing forth occasional  
monstrosities. About a year ago, a massive army of  
plaguechanged creatures emerged from the  
plagueland and laid siege to the city of Elturel.  
In some quarters, Elturgard  
has garnered a reputation for being too righteous.  
Many problems attend its inflexible laws, inquisitorial  
persecution of evil, and bold plans for “setting Faerûn  
aright.  
Everyn Cadwy  
Male human (Lawful Good)  
Appears in: SPEC2-1, ELTU3-1  
Everyn stands around six and a half feet tall, with good  
posture and a winning smile. His sandy blond hair is  
worn loose around his face and his armor is impeccably  
clean. This is a man who takes pride in his appearance,  
both inward and outward.  
Personality: Everyn is stiff, but fair and warms up to  
people the more he knows them. He is more than  
willing to listen to reason and has calmed down much  
since his younger years.  
History: Everyn Cadwy grew up in a merchant family  
based in Elturgard and had a happy childhood. Unlike  
many people in this region his life isn’t marred with a  
horrid past and because of this Everyn is resilient to the  
horrors he sees as a paladin of the Order of Torm. He  
joined the Order because he wanted to help those who  
did not grow up as lucky as he did and he believes that  
the law can protect the less fortunate. He is genuinely  
and simply a good guy.  
The following information can be gained with a  
Streetwise check:  
Streetwise DC 10: Everyn is a paladin of Torm and  
has had interactions with adventurers before. Perhaps  
the most suspicious thing about him is that there is  
nothing suspicious about him.  
Streetwise DC 15: Everyn is the owner of small,  
white, fluffy dog by the name of Gigi. It is a dog he  
inherited from his mother when she passed away.  
Streetwise DC 20: Everyn has a younger brother  
Jalden who is also in the Order of Torm. He often has to  
cover up lazy mistakes that Jalden makes while on duty;  
however Everyn stays ever loyal to his family ties.

ЭЛТУРЕЛЬ

Элтурель находится на холме, освещаемом све¬том Компаньона, и смотрит на реку Чионтар у его подножья.

Элтурель - важный пункт на торговых путях, про¬ходящих через Западное Сердцеземье, и для путе-шественников по этим путям он и его окрестности представляют собой островок безопасности, как и для самих его граждан. Этой безопасностью город

в основном обязан усилиям Всадников Ада, чья кавалерия патрулирует дороги, ведущие в Элтургард, а также местность вдоль реки.

В центре города, прямо под Компаньоном, нахо¬дится скалистых холм, на котором стоит Главный Зал. В этом замке, чьи стены окружают пик холма, живет Верховный Смотритель, и служит основная часть бюрократического аппарата Элтургарда. из центра замка проистекает поток, порождаемый мощными источниками в его подвалах. Поток течет на север через вершину холма и стекает с его утесов каскадом водопадов, называемых Девичьи Прыжки. Поток проходит по рву вдоль восточного Портового Района и впадает в реку Чионтар. на про¬тивоположной стороне потока пролегает длинный, узкий сад, полный цветов, тенистых тропинок под сенью деревьев, и изогнутых мостиков. Сад - люби¬мое место встреч жителей Элтуреля, и он сохраня¬ет свое дикое очарование и зимой. Богатая часть населения города предпочитает селиться поближе к саду на склоне холма, а остальные люди живут ниже, ближе к реке, в высоких узких домах со мно¬жеством окон и балконов.

Несмотря на все ее плюсы, к постоянной иллюми¬нации в Элтуреле бывает сложновато привыкнуть путешественникам. Постоялые дворы и ночлежки обычно закрывают окна комнат своих постояль¬цев плотными шторами, не пропускающими свет, чтобы гости могли поспать. Без восходов и закатов, служащих началом и концом рабочего дня, горожа¬не полагаются на звон колоколов Главного Зала для этих целей.

Из-за отсутствия природной темноты в городе происходит меньше всего такого, что в других местах происходит под ее покровом. В Элтуреле низкий уровень драк и нападений в переулках вокруг постоялых дворов и таверн, а те, кто занима¬ется воровством, должны быть особо осторожны и удачливы.
