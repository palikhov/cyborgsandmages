### Weapon Charms

_Wondrous item_

A weapon charm is a small ornament fixed on a loop of string or chain. You can use your action to attach the charm on a weapon, usually on the weapon's pommel, causing the weapon to become a magic weapon that requires attunement. Even if the weapon was already magical, you must attune to it again to gain the charm's magical benefits, which are listed in the charm's description. A weapon can only have one charm attached at a time.

Bat (Uncommon). This obsidian charm appears like a shrieking bat. While attached, when you deal damage to a creature with this weapon, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

Blade (Uncommon). This adamantine charm is shaped like a miniature longsword. While attached, you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus doesn't apply to magical weapons that already have a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Die (Uncommon). This silver charm depicts a six-sided die. While attached, the weapon deals more potent critical hits. When you score a critical hit, if you roll the maximum number on any damage die, you can roll an extra damage die and add its damage to the total, rolling again if this die is also the maximum number, and so on. You can roll a total number of damage dice for this critical hit equal to twice the number of damage dice you initially rolled.

Feather (Common). This gold charm of a feather feels unusually light. While attached, this weapon weighs half as much as usual. Small creatures can effectively use the weapon, even if it has the Heavy property.

Ghost (Common). This crystal charm is carved into the shape of a wispy spirit. While attached, the weapon can affect creatures on the Ethereal Plane as if they were on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

Hook (Common). This bronze charm is shaped like a fishing hook. When attached, if the weapon is on the same plane of existence, you can use your bonus action to teleport it to your hand.

Lance (Uncommon). This copper charm depicts a short lance. While attached, once on each of your turns when you make a melee attack with this weapon against a creature you can see, you can lunge up to 15 feet toward your target before making the attack. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can perform this movement even if it causes you to travel through the air, though you fall after making the attack if you do not land on solid ground.

Lightning Bolt (Uncommon). This mithral charm depicts a wild lightning bolt. While attached, this weapon deals an extra 1d6 lightning damage to any target it hits.

Mirror (Rare). This shiny platinum charm depicts an elegant hand mirror. This charm can only be attached to a weapon with the Light property. When attached, when you draw the weapon with one hand, a spectral duplicate of the weapon appears in your other hand. This spectral duplicate has identical statistics to the original weapon, including its magical effects, but doesn't include ammunition. When the attached weapon or its spectral duplicate leaves your hand, the duplicate vanishes.
