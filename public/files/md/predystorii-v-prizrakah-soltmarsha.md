### Fisher

You have spent your life aboard fishing vessels or combing the shallows for the bounty of the ocean. Perhaps you were born into a family of fisher folk, working with your kin to feed your village. Maybe the job was a means to an end — a way out of an undesirable circumstance that forced you to take up life aboard a ship. Regardless of how you began, you soon fell in love with the sea, the art of fishing, and the promise of the eternal horizon.

**Skill Proficiencies:** History, Survival

**Languages:** One of your choice

**Equipment:** Fishing tackle, a net, a favorite fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Harvest the Water

You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.

#### Fishing Tale

You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM’s discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character. Alternatively, work with your DM to create your own fishing tale.

| d8  | Tale                                                                                                                                                     |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Lobster Wrestling.** You fought in hand-to-hand combat with an immense lobster.                                                                        |
| 2   | **It Dragged the Boat.** You nearly caught a fish of monstrous size that pulled your boat for miles.                                                     |
| 3   | **Fins of Pure Gold.** You caught a sea animal whose fins were made of pure gold, but another fisher stole it.                                           |
| 4   | **Ghost Fish.** You are haunted by a ghostly fish that only you can see.                                                                                 |
| 5   | **Nemesis Clam.** A large clam containing a pearl the size of your head claimed one of your fingers before jetting away; one day, you’ll find that clam. |
| 6   | **It Swallowed the Sun.** You once saw a fish leap from the water and turn day into night.                                                               |
| 7   | **Dive into the Abyss.** You found yourself in an underwater cave leading to the Abyss, and your luck has been sour ever since.                          |
| 8   | **Love Story.** You fell in love with a creature of pure water, but your brief romance ended tragically.                                                 |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Fishers succeed only if they spend time at their jobs. As such, most fishers have a strong work ethic, and they admire others who earn their living honestly. Fishers tend to be superstitious, forming attachments to particular fishing lures or special fishing spots. They have a connection to the bodies of water in which they fish, and they think poorly of those whose actions adversely affect their livelihood.

### Marine

You were trained for battle on sandy beaches and rocky shores. You have launched midnight raids from swift ships whose names evoke terror in the hearts of your adversaries. The water is your second home, the rain your shelter, and the crashing waves your battle cry.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Survival

**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water, land)

**Equipment:** A dagger that belonged to a fallen comrade, a folded flag emblazoned with the symbol of your ship or company, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Steady

You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march (see “Travel Pace” in chapter 8 of the *Player’s Handbook*). Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.

#### Hardship Endured

Hardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions. You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that best fits your character.

| d6  | Hardship                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Nearly Drowned.** You hid underwater to avoid detection by enemies and held your breath for an extremely long time. Just before you would have died, you had a revelation about your existence.         |
| 2   | **Captured.** You spent months enduring thirst, starvation, and torture at the hands of your enemy, but you never broke.                                                                                  |
| 3   | **Sacrifice.** You enabled the escape of your fellow soldiers, but at great cost to yourself. Some of your past comrades may think you’re dead.                                                           |
| 4   | **Juggernaut.** No reasonable explanation can explain how you survived a particular battle. Every arrow and bolt missed you. You slew scores of enemies single-handedly and led your comrades to victory. |
| 5   | **Stowaway.** For days, you hid in the bilge of an enemy ship, surviving on brackish water and foolhardy rats. At the right moment, you crept up to the deck and took over the ship on your own.          |
| 6   | **Leave None Behind.** You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death.                                                                                                                |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Marines are looked up to by other soldiers and respected by their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers. Though they are self-reliant, marines tend to operate best in groups, valuing camaraderie and the companionship of like-minded individuals.

#### Saltmarsh Ties

As a former member of Saltmarsh’s elite marine contingent, you are friends of Tom and Will Stoutly and can turn to them for help and support. Eliander Fireborn, captain of the guard, also makes time to listen to your concerns.

### Shipwright

You have sailed into war on the decks of great ships, patching their hulls with soup bowls and prayers. You once helped build a fishing vessel that single-handedly saved a town from starvation. You have seen a majestic prow in your dreams that you have not been able to replicate in wood. Since childhood, you have loved the water and have been captivated by the many vessels that travel on it.

**Skill Proficiencies:** History, Perception

**Tool Proficiencies:** Carpenter’s tools, vehicles (water)

**Equipment:** A set of well-loved carpenter’s tools, a blank book, 1 ounce of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a leather pouch with 10 gp

#### Feature: I’ll Patch It!

Provided you have carpenter’s tools and wood, you can perform repairs on a water vehicle. When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 × your proficiency modifier. A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired.

#### Life at Sea

Your life at sea and in port has shaped you; you can roll on the following table to determine its impact or choose an element that best fits your character.

| d6  | Sea’s Influence                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Grand Designs.** You are working on plans and schematics for a new, very fast ship. You must examine as many different kinds of vessels as possible to help ensure the success of your design.                       |
| 2   | **Solid and Sound.** You patched up a war galley and prevented it from sinking. The local navy regards you as a friend.                                                                                                |
| 3   | **Favored.** You insisted on thicker planking for a merchant vessel’s hull, which saved it from sinking when it smashed against a reef. You have a standing invitation to visit the merchant’s distant mansion.        |
| 4   | **Master of Armaments.** You specialized in designing and mounting defenses for the navy. You easily recognize and determine the quality of such items.                                                                |
| 5   | **Low Places.** You have contacts in the smuggling outfits along the coast; you occasionally repair the criminals’ ships in exchange for coin and favors.                                                              |
| 6   | **Mysteries of the Deep.** You experienced an encounter with a possibly divine being while sailing alone. Work with your DM to determine the secret about the deep waters of the sea that this entity revealed to you. |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Shipwrights are resourceful carpenters and designers. They often have a dedicated spot at the local tavern, since shipwrights are invaluable to coastal communities. Some travel with naval fleets and might serve as officers if their temperament suits it. Shipwrights have an affinity for working with their hands and often perform feats of carpentry that others might deem miraculous.

| 4   | I am so obsessed with sketching my ideas for elaborate inventions that I sometimes forget little thing like eating and sleeping. |
| 5   | I’m judgmental of those who are not skilled with tools of some kind.                                                             |
| 6   | I sometimes take things that don’t belong to me, especially if they are very well made.                                          |

### Smuggler

On a rickety barge, you carried a hundred longswords in fish barrels right past the dock master’s oblivious lackeys. You have paddled a riverboat filled with stolen elven wine under the gaze of the moon and sold it for twice its value in the morning. In your more charitable times, you have transported innocents out of war zones or helped guide herd animals to safety on the banks of a burning river.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Deception

**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water)

**Equipment:** A fancy leather vest or a pair of leather boots, a set of common clothes, and a leather pouch with 15 gp

#### Feature: Down Low

You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM’s discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret.

#### Claim to Fame

Every smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from common criminals. By wits, sailing skill, or a silver tongue, you lived to tell the story — and you tell it often. You can roll on the following table to determine your claim or choose one that best fits your character.

| d6  | Accomplishment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 1   | **Spirit of the Whale.** You smuggled stolen dwarven spirits in the body of a dead whale being pulled behind a fishing boat. When you delivered the goods, the corpse suddenly exploded, sending whale meat and whiskey bottles for half a mile.      |
| 2   | **Cart and Sword.** You drove a cart filled with stolen art through the middle of a battlefield while singing sea shanties to confuse the combatants.                                                                                                 |
| 3   | **The Recruit.** You enlisted in another nation’s navy for the purpose of smuggling stolen jewels to a distant port. You attained a minor rank before disappearing from the navy and making your way here.                                            |
| 4   | **River of Shadows.** Your riverboat accidentally slipped through the veil into the Shadowfell for several hours. While you were there, you sold some stolen dragonborn artifacts before returning to this plane and paddling home.                   |
| 5   | **Gold-Hearted.** You agreed to transport a family escaping a war. The baby began to cry at a checkpoint, and you gave the guards all your gold to let you pass. The family never found out about this gesture.                                       |
| 6   | **Playing Both Sides.** You once smuggled crates of crossbow bolts and bundles of arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery. |

#### Suggested Characteristics

In general, smugglers value survival, and then profit, above other things. One could be a part of a larger organization, or might run a small smuggling vessel of their own. Smugglers live the lies they have told, and they have a natural ability to recall all the falsehoods and half-truths they have ever spouted.
