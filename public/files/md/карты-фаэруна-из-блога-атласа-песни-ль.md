Мацтика -

Maztica, referred to by its natives as “the True World” and by the colonialist Faerûnians who “discovered” it as “the New World”, lies to the west of Faerûn across the Trackless Sea. It was only officially “discovered” ten years ago, in 1361 DR, by Captain Cordell of the Golden Company of Amn, who landed a fleet on the east coast. However, it is believed that the elves of nearby Evermeet had much greater knowledge of the continent extending back millennia, and the Northmen of the Trackless Sea may have explored some of its north-eastern fringes some time ago without realising it was part of a much greater landmass.

The explored region of Maztica lies towards the southern end of the continent and runs from roughly due west of Amn to due west of Chult and Halruaa. This region extends for about 1,800 miles from north to south is about 800 miles wide. Magical divinations have revealed that the entire landmass extends for 4,500 miles from north to south and is around 2,000 miles wide at its widest extent in the north, and incorporates several offshore islands.

Nomenclature

One of the most fiercely-debated topics in Faerûnian cartographic circles – to the point where blows have been exchanged and curses sought – is to what extent “Maztica” should be said to incorporate the entire landmass or if it should only be said to include the southern explored region. This point is debate most fiercely between the merchant lords of Amn, who “discovered” the continent and gave it its name (actually adapting the local name), and the Dukes of Baldur’s Gate, who hold that Maztica is in actuality the fabled  and over-accented continent of Anchôromé, discovered by great Balduran himself, and the entire landmass should be known by that name. A compromise, that “Maztica” applies to the southern region and Anchôromé to the north, has achieved some popularity in recent years.

However, this compromise has been rejected by some learned mages of note, who instead contend that Anchôromé is more properly the name given to a vast archipelago of hundreds of islands located off the north-eastern coast of Maztica and extending to within 300 miles of the island kingdom of Tuern, far to the north-east of Evermeet, and Balduran’s explorations were actually in this region and he never set foot on the continent beyond. The matter remains fiercely debated.

Faerûnian Colonies in the True World

Several nations and powers of Faerûn have established holdings on the continent of Maztica but a full-scale colonisation effort has been prevented due to the events following Captain Cordell’s arrival. Cordell’s small army, with its heavy armour, stronger weapons and offensive magic, proved superior to the natives of Payit and Pezelac, the regions where they landed (and which are now loosely grouped as “New Amn,” a grandiose name that suggests more authority than the Amnians actually have), but was less effective against the professional, well-trained army of Kultaka to the west and to the extremely hostile depredations of the Nexalese Empire to the south-west. After a series of brutal battles, a series of events was set in motion that saw the restoration of the exiled Maztican god Qotal, the utter destruction of Nexal by volcanic eruption and the formation of a loose alliance between the Amnian forces and several native powers.

In the resulting chaos, the Maztican pantheon, represented by the god Qotal, permitted the establishment of Faerûnian colonies in Maztica without contest in a limited manner, as recompense for the Faerûnian help (particularly of those followers of Helm among the Amnian mercenaries) in destroying Nexal and restoring balance to Maztica. Any large-scale invasion of Maztica by Faerûnian powers would be extremely ill-advised, as it would also require both a magical and religious incursion into areas controlled by a different pantheon, and only achievable by endangering the Balance of the planet (maintained by Ao).

The current colonies in Maztica are therefore limited, consisting solely of Helmsport (which is essentially a district of the native port of Ulatos given over to the Amnians), New Waterdeep on the Gulf of Kultaka, Trythosford (a sub-colony of New Waterdeep) to the far north and Fort Flame (a colony of Baldur’s Gate) even further north, on the Bay of Balduran. Another outpost established by Fort Flame to the north was destroyed some years ago. Worshippers of Gond in Lantan have also built the Great Lighthouse on the island of St. Ippen, but have not yet established holdings on the mainland.

Geographic Regions of Maztica

Explored Maztica consists of several key geographic regions.

- The Pasocada Basin (consisting of badlands, mesas, buttes and river valleys) in the north-west, dominated by Mihaca, the fabled City of Gold.
- The Borderlands, dominated by the Faerûnian colonies of New Waterdeep and Trythosford.
- Huacli, a nation of city-states conquered by Nexal but which recently regained its freedom.
- Nexal, formerly the greatest empire in the True World until its destruction ten years ago.
- Kultaka, a fierce nation of (mostly) honourable warriors who defend its independence with ferocity, but are happy to trade with friendly outlanders.
- Pezelac and Payit, more temperate lands which are united (somewhat uneasily) with Faerûnian colonists as the nation of New Amn (a name which suggests a much firmer outlander control of the region that perhaps is the case).
- Far Payit, consisting of a massive peninsula, dominated by the Narabatun and Ocostun jungles and the Palankal mountain range that forms its spine.
- Kolan, a nation on the west coast which blended several Maztican cultures, including the Nexalese of the north and the Green Folk of the south. Kolan paid tribute to Nexal, but has recently regained full autonomy.
- The House of Tezca, a vast desert extending far to the south.
- The Chapultelel Jungle, which extends across the entire southern end of the landmass and is the home of the Green Folk, a private people.
- Lopango, the Land of Fire, which consists of a large mountain range (with some active volcanoes) rising up beyond Chapultelel and dominating a large body of land beyond (which rivals the rest of explored Maztica in size). Attempts to explore this region have met with fierce resistance by the natives. Beyond Lopango lies the unexplored continent of Katashaka.

Mapping the Realms

Greenwood’s original map of the Realms focused on the continent of Faerûn, extending west to the island of Evermeet; south to the jungles of Chult and the island of Nimbral beyond; east to Semphar and the Horse Plains; and north to the towering Spine of the World mountain range and the Endless Ice Sea beyond. He had little notion of what lay elsewhere in the world, except for a huge island chain to the north-west called Anchôromé.

Other writers and editors soon expanded the setting. The 1985 Oriental Adventures book by Dave “Zeb” Cook had detailed an Asia-like land called Kara-Tur. This was retconned (and shrunk in the process) into the eastern half of the continent in the Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms boxed set (1988). In 1990 the Horde boxed set explored the Tuigan plains which linked the two subcontinents. In 1991, the Maztica Campaign Set added a new continent far to the west of Faerûn. In 1992 the Al-Qadim sub-setting was launched, detailing the lands of Zakhara to the south of Faerûn.

Through all of these boxed sets, adventures and campaign guides, maps were a constant feature. Not just maps of the continents and landmasses, but maps of individual countries, cities, streets and even individual buildings. The City System (1988) set contains a colossal map of Waterdeep which is too big to fit inside most average-sized homes, and names virtually every building in the city. The Forgotten Realms is almost certainly the most heavily-mapped fantasy world in existence, with literally thousands of maps existing of its various locations.

Despite that, a full, canonical world map of the entire planet of Abeir-toril had to wait until the release of the Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas (1999) on CD-ROM. The atlas featured almost every single map from every single Realms product ever released plus lots of new ones, and also a complete world map which added multiple new continents to the planet. Ed Greenwood would later reveal some new information on these continents, but, twenty years later, they have still received scant development compared to the originals.

The first-ever canonical world map of Toril, from the long out-of-print Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas (1999) by [ProFantasy](https://www.profantasy.com/default.asp).

A New Map of Toril

My new map of Toril depicts the planet as it stood between the 2nd and 3rd Editions of the setting. When 3rd Edition setting was released in 2001, the map-makers chose to shrink the main continent of Faerûn to remove empty space in the south; given that Faerûn was never the biggest fantasy continent in the first place, sometimes straining credulity given how packed it was, this was unnecessary and was eventually reversed in 5th Edition.

4th Edition, much more controversially, blew up the continent in a magical catastrophe known as the Spellplague and completely reshaped it. Fortunately, most of these changes were promptly abandoned in 5th Edition, which restored the continent to its former glory.

To create this map, I used a base model from my twenty-year-old copy of the Forgotten Realms Interactive Atlas (this also inspired some colour choices, particularly for the mountains) and information from canon sources and from some of the better fan maps out there. A more detailed map of Faerûn will – hopefully! – follow, although it will be considerable work.

Toril as seen from space.

The World of Abeir-toril

The world of the Forgotten Realms is an Earth-sized planet called Abeir-toril, “Cradle of Life” in Auld Wyrmish. Toril is the third of eight planets in its star system, and it possesses one large satellite, Selûne, and dozens of smaller satellites, asteroid-sized bodies called the Tears of Selûne.

Toril is divided between one very large continental landmass, almost big enough to qualify as a supercontinent, and three other continent-sized bodies. Five large island-continents and thousands of smaller continents are also known to exist.

The main continental landmass is divided into three lesser continents or subcontinents:

- Faerûn is located in the west of this landmass, running from the Endless Ice Sea to the Great Sea and from the Trackless Sea to the Tuigan Plains (or Hordelands) in the east. Faerûn is the original and principle setting for the Forgotten Realms campaign and by far the area of the planet with the most development. Faerûn vaguely resembles Europe and the Near and Middle-East in the medieval period, with the landlocked Sea of Fallen Stars serving as a Mediterranean analogue.
- Kara-Tur is located to the east of Faerûn and is the home of the mostly-defunct Oriental Adventures and Living Jungle sub-settings. It is an Asian-inspired land of vast empires, huge cities and adventure. Kara-Tur is the home of the largest nation on Toril, the Shou Lung Empire, and the tallest mountain range, the Yehimal, which is even taller than the Himalayas.
- Zakhara, the Land of Fate, lies south of Faerûn and south-west of Kara-Tur. The home of the Al-Qadim sub-setting, it is a land of vast, boiling deserts and cities clustered around oases and bays. Zakhara is inspired by the mythology of Arabia. The largest single city on the planet, Golden Huzuz, can be found in Zakhara.

In addition, several other continents can be found elsewhere in the world:

- Maztica, the True World, lies to the west of Faerûn across the Trackless Sea. It is inspired by Aztec and Mayan mythology and consists of jungles, volcanoes and deserts. North of Maztica lies a land of open plains more reminiscent of the American West, although this area has not been explored much in canon materials.
- Katashaka lies to the south of Maztica and consists of steaming, hot jungles inhabited by various hostile lizardfolk. Katashaka seems to have been inspired by South America, but it has received relatively little development so far.
- Ossë is a large landmass lying to the east of Kara-Tur. It is quite hot, sparsely-populated and has not yet been explored in detail in any canon materials. Based on the limited information available, it appears to be a supersized version of Australia.

There are numerous islands of note in the world, the most famous of which are Evermeet, the home of the elves located far across the Trackless Sea; the Moonshae Isles off the coast of Faerûn; Lantan, the land of engineers and tinkerers; Nimbral, the mysterious Sea-Haven; the islands of Anchôromé off the coast of Maztica; Wa and Kozakura off the coast of Kara-Tur; and the large island-continents of Myrmidune, Tabaxiland, Aurune and Braaklosia, about which relatively little has been revealed.

- Orlumbor: a tiny kingdom located on a small island off the Sword Coast of Faerûn. Highly influential due to its excellent dockyards and shipbuilding facilities, and natural defences which make raids difficult. Capital: Orlumbor. Ruler: Tulgar Wrightsson.
- Waterdeep: the largest city-state of Faerûn north of Calimshan, wielding immense and near-unmatched political power over a vast swathe of the continent. In recent years Waterdeep’s power has expanded to encompass most of the lands within a hundred miles of the city, and its political power (via the Lords’ Alliance, which extends as far as Neverwinter, Luruar and Baldur’s Gate) is much greater. Capital: Waterdeep. Ruler: Open Lord Piergeiron Paladinson (representing the Council of the Lords of Waterdeep).
- Luruar: also called the Realm of the Silver Marches, Luruar is the newest kingdom of Faerûn, founded in the past two years as an alliance of several major human, elven and dwarven petty-kingdoms, city-states and townships in the region known as the North. Capital: Silverymoon. Ruler: Lady Alustriel Silverhand (representing the Council of Luruar).
- Hartsvale: an isolated and relatively little-known human kingdom, located on the far side of the Ice Spires and Ice Mountains from Luruar, with the Endless Ice Sea to the north and the High Ice to the east. Cold and inhospitable, frequently ravaged by hostile giant and ogre raids, it nevertheless endures. Capital: Hartwick Castle. Ruler: King Tavis Burdun and Queen Brianna Burdun.
- Evereska: the most powerful elven nation still extant in Faerûn, located on the western fringes of the Great Desert Anauroch in a series of valleys and hill chains far from civilisation. More than 21,000 elves live in Evereska. Capital: Evereska. Ruler: the High Elders.
- Evermeet: the most powerful elven nation on all Toril, located on a large island in the Trackless Sea over a thousand miles to the west of Moonshae. Over a million and a half elves live in Evermeet, representing the overwhelming majority of the elven race still alive on the planet. Evermeet is the destination of those elves seeking to leave the mainland and find a peaceful home elsewhere. Capital: Leuthilspar. Ruler: Queen Amlaruil Moonflower.
- Cormyr: a powerful human kingdom under the rule of law, located at the far western end of the Sea of Fallen Stars (on the Lake of Dragons) and extending north to the Great Desert of Anauroch. The Storm Horn and Thunder Peak mountain ranges protect Cormyr’s borders. Cormyr is both militarily and economically powerful. It has uneasy relations with Sembia to the east. Capital: Suzail. Ruler: King Azoun Obarskyr IV.
- Sembia: a large and rich trading nation to the east of Cormyr, stretching along much of the north-western coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Sembia is less of a single kingdom and more of an alliance of several semi-independent city-states. Its fractiousness has so far prevented Sembia from exerting greater influence over the region. Capital: Ordulin. Ruler: Overmaster Elduth Yarmmaster and the Sembian Merchants’ Council.
- Impiltur: a feudal kingdom located on the north-eastern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Capital: Lyrabar. Ruler: King Imbrar II of the Heltharn Dynasty.
- Damara: a fractious feudal kingdom located north of Impiltur, at the feet of the Great Glacier. The kingdom was divided into baronies and duchies constantly feuding with one another. During the Bloodstone Wars, when the kingdom was invaded by Zhengyi the Witch-King and his army out of Vaasa, the nation was saved by the paladin Gareth Dragonsbane, who subsequently unified the country. Capital: Heliogabalus. Ruler: King Gareth Dragonsbane.
- Vaasa: a region of bandits and hostile human and goblin tribes at the feet of the Great Glacier. Unified by the Witch-King Zhengyi ere his defeat in the Bloodstone Wars. Only debateably still a nation, although the rulers of the town of Telos have made some efforts to keep the unity of Zhengyi going to encourage trade. Capital: Telos (formerly Castle Perilous). Ruler: none acknowledged.
- Narfell: home to the Nars, a nomadic race of herders and warriors, who range over vast lands along the Great Glacier and extending as far as the Lake of Tears. Capital: Bildoobaris. Ruler: Thalaman Harthgroth, spokesman for the Tribal Council of Narfell.
- Sossal: a large but extremely remote kingdom, located on the far side of the Great Glacier along the Great Ice Sea. Extremely enigmatic. Capital: unknown, although Naupau is the only known trading settlement. The inland city of Sundice may be the capital. Ruler: unknown, although it is known that the last King of Sossal died some sixty years ago. How the nation has been ruled since then is unknown.
- Thesk: a loosely-allied trading confederation (consisting of the towns and cities of Culmaster, Phent, Inkra, Phsant, Tammar and Two-Stars, but strongly influenced by the nearby city-state of Telflamm) stretching from the Sea of Fallen Stars eastwards to Ashane, the Lake of Tears. Noted as being the battleground for the Tuigan Invasion and the subsequent Great Crusade in response to it. Much of eastern Thesk has still not yet been repopulated. Capital: none. Government: merchant oligarchy.
- Rashemen: a formidable kingdom located between the Lake of Tears, Lake Musantir and the High Country, on what some consider to be the eastern edge of Faerûn. The nation consists of “barbarian” warriors of formidable repute allied to the Witches of Rashemen, magic-users of impressive power. They are united in their opposition to Thay to the south. Capital: Immilmar. Ruler: Iron Lord Hyarmon Hussilthar.
- Thay: arguably the most ill-omened nation of Faerûn, the homeland of the “Red Wizards” and their hordes of goblinoid and undead minions. Thay’s power is kept in check only by the combined antagonism of its neighbours, particularly Rashemen, Aglarond and Mulhorand. Capital: Eltabbar. Ruler: the Council of Zulkirs (of whom the most powerful is Szass Tam, Zulkir of Necromancy).
- Aglarond: a peaceful, relatively tranquil nation of farmers, elves and half-elves located between the Yuirwood and the Sea of Fallen Stars. Ruled by the Simbul, possibly the most powerful sorceress in the Realms. A sworn enemy of Thay to the east. Capital: Velprintalar. Ruler: the Simbul.
- Mulhorand: the most ancient, still-extant human kingdom of Faerûn, a kingdom of pyramids, undead and strange gods, located along the Alamber Sea and extending inland to Raurin, the Great Dust Desert. Still powerful but often quiet, Mulhorand is described as a sleeping giant whose power even the Red Wizards hesitate to provoke. Capital: Skuld, the City of Shadows. Ruler: Pharaoh Horustep III.
- Murghôm: a former vassal of Mulhorand, located to the east of the Ganathwood and north of the Rauthenflow. Murghôm is a powerful and populous kingdom, frequently clashing with Semphar to the east. Capital: Murghyr. Ruler: King Tharmakkas IV.
-  Semphar: another former vassal of Mulhorand’s, located to the east of Murghôm and Brightstar Lake. Semphar is one of the eastern-most kingdoms of Faerûn, located hard against the borders of the continent of Kara-Tur (which lie to the east, beyond the vast Yehimal mountain chains) and the Raurin Desert to the south. It is a nation primarily concerned with trade, taking advantage of its position at the junction of two continents. Capital: Dhaztanar. Ruler: Caliph Abu Bakr.
- Unther: an ancient empire, rival to Mulhorand, located across the Alamber Sea to the west and north of the vast plains of the Shaar. For many centuries Unther was a tyrannical empire under the rule of the God-King Gilgeam. Gilgeam was recently destroyed by the draconic goddess Tiamat, but she was badly wounded in the process and unable to conquer the realm. Capital: Unthalass. Ruler: none, each city is fending for itself until a new ruler can unite the nation.
- Threskel: a small kingdom located along the south-eastern arm of the Sea of Fallen Stars. A former vassal of Unther, Threskel was wrested from its control by a powerful blue dragon, now a dracolich and still nominally the realm’s ruler. Capital: Mourktar. Ruler: Alasklerbanbastos the Blue, a dracolich of impressive power. An appointed county deals with the mundanities of ruling the nation.
- Chessenta: a former vassal of Unther, now arguably more powerful than its parent kingdom. Chessenta is located along the southern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars and is more of a union of extremely rich city-states than a single kingdom The cities feud with one another as much as they do outsiders. Capital: nominally Luthcheq. Ruler: nominally Tchazzar, Father of Chessenta, although he has been missing for many years. In practice each city has its own ruler.
- Chondath: a formerly extremely powerful empire located along the Vilhon Reach, much reduced in recent years to a trading nation following centuries of civil conflict and war with the elves of the neighbouring Chondalwood. Capital: Arrabar. Ruler: Lord Eles Wianar.
- Sespech: formerly a vassal of Chondath’s, now broken away. Capital: Ormpetarr. Ruler: Baron Aldorn Thuragar.
- Turmish: a powerful and influential kingdom on the southern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars, heavily defended thanks to being surrounded on all landward sides by mountains. Famed for its mercantile power. Capital: Alaghôn. Ruler: Lord Herengar, representing the Assembly of Stars.
- Amn: one of the richest kingdoms of Faerûn, thanks to its discovery and colonisation of the continent of Maztica across the Trackless Sea some ten years ago. Currently engaged in a protracted and bitter war with ogres and giants to the south-west, who are besieging the port of Murann. Capital: Athkatla. Ruler: the Council of Six.
- Tethyr: a large feudal kingdom in the south-west of Faerûn. Recovering from a lengthy civil war. Capital: Darromar. Ruler: Queen Zaranda Star Rhindaun and King Haedrak III Rhindaun.
- Calimshan: a mercantile and trading nation, at times the most populous nation of Faerûn and one of the most powerful and ancient, with a history extending back some 7,000 years. Its capital Calimport, is the most populous city in Faerûn. Capital: Calimport. Ruler: Syl-Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal.
- Lantan: an island kingdom in the Trackless Sea, just off the coast of Chult. Noted for its industry and high technology compared to the rest of Faerûn. Inhabited primarily by humans and gnomes. Capital: Sambar. Ruler: the Ayrorch (a ruling council of twelve members).
- Tharsult: an island kingdom in the Shining Sea, located between Calimshan and the city-states of the Chultan Peninsula. It has a reputation for shady dealings. Capital: Urbeth.
- Nimbral: an island kingdom located on the border between the Trackless Sea (to the north and west) and the Great Sea (to the south and east). Extremely remote and mystery, jealously guarding its independence and security. Capital: Selpiir. Rulers: the Nimbral Lords.
- Lapaliiya: also called the Lapal League, a confederation of city-states on the south-eastern shores of the Shining Sea, joined together for mutual trade and defence. Capital: Sheirtalar. Rulers: the Grand Council, made up of representatives of each city. The Overking of Sheirtalar (currently Shaliim Wyrmslayer) is by tradition the most powerful of the Council, but only as a first among equals.
- Tashalar: a rich mercantile nation famed for its wine, located on the southern coast of the Shining Sea on the edge of the Mhair Jungle. Capital: Tashluta. Government: merchant oligarchy.
- Thindol: a mercantile kingdom dominating the middle of the Chultan Peninsula, between the Mhair Jungle to the east and the Jungles of Chult to the north-west, enriched by having good harbours on both the Shining Sea to the north and the Great Sea to the south. Capital: Thindar. Government: merchant council.
- Samarach: a highly paranoid and reclusive nation located on the south coast of the Chultan Peninsula. The kingdom has virtually no contact with the outside world, aside from very limited trade with neighbouring Thindol. Samarach is believed to be a mainland vassal of Nimbral which now has strained relations with the motherland. Capital: Samargol. Ruler: monarchy, current ruler unknown.
- Halruaa: one of the most fabled lands in all Faerûn, a kingdom of wizards and airships where magic and sorcery is practised on a scale unmatched elsewhere in Faerûn and probably the world. Sealed behind towering mountain ranges, Halruaa is a land of wonders and riches beyond compare. Capital: Halarahh. Government: the Council of Elders.
- Dambrath: a large and notable kingdom of the Shining South, stretching from the Forest of Amtar in the north to the Bay of Dancing Dolphins. Its people are a curious mix of human and drow blood, and its religion a strange blend worshipping both drow and human gods, particularly Lolth and Loviatar. The nation has a fell reputation, but is also disciplined and lawful. The kingdom has a strong trade relationship with surrounding kingdoms and even the continent of Zakhara to the south-east, across the Shining Sea. Population: Cathyr. Ruler: Queen Hasafir Hazm’cri.
- Luiren: the famed kingdom of halflings, located between the Toadsquat Mountains and the Luirenstrand, an inlet of the Great Sea. Capital: Beluir. Ruler: Autocrat Faran Ferromar.
- Estagund: one of the Shining Lands, a powerful trading nation on the Great Sea, formerly allied with its neighbours Var to the east and Durpar to the north-east. Capital: Chavyondat. Ruler: hereditary monarch
- Var: also called Var the Golden, for its golden beaches and the small deserts located in the interior. A trading nation on the Great Sea, guarding the entrance to the Golden Water. Sometimes accounted the south-easternmost nation of Faerûn, due to the debatable nature of the Utter East kingdoms beyond. Capital: Pyratar. Government: hereditary monarchy.
- Durpar: the most powerful of the Shining Lands and the most powerful kingdom south of the Raurin Desert and east of Halruaa. It is located on and around the Golden Water. Capital: Heldapan. Government: The Council of Merchants.
- Veldorn: not so much a nation as the absence of a nation, Veldorn is often called the Beastlands. An accumulation of dead cities and ruins dating from the time of the Imaskari Empire, as well as more recent territory seized from Durpar and Estagund. Occasionally the region is united by a particularly powerful entity, but only with great difficulty.
- Ulgarth: the most well-known kingdom of the “Utter East,” the lands located south and east of the Golden Water and Raurin Desert which are only really counted as part of Faerûn because the continent of Kara-Tur lies further east, beyond the Yehimal, and Zakhara much further to the south, beyond the World Pillar Mountains. Capital: Orvyltar. Ruler: King Drasna Bluemantle.
- Parsanic: an alliance of five city-states on the Great Sea, south of Ulgarth. Little is known of them.
- Edenvale: a mysterious kingdom east of Ulgarth and Parsanic, in the foothills of the towering Yehimal. The kingdom appears to have been settled by Ffolk and Northmen of the Moonshae Isles; how they travelled so far from their homeland remains unclear. Capital: Edenvale Castle. Ruler: Queen Rosalind.
- Doegan:  mysterious kingdom south of Parsanic and Edenvale, on the Great Sea. Capital: Eldrinpar. Ruler: hereditary monarch.
- Konigheim: the south-eastern most kingdom of the Faerûn continent. Inhabited by descendants of the Northmen, apparently transported from the Trackless Sea centuries ago. Capital: Konigheim. Ruler: warlord.
