### [E5E SPELLCASTING - SPELLS - 3 LVL 29052022.docx](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Atcrhwwo1lBA19hlYcncOtxGm2fmTA?e=tBcC4j)

### Alarm Object

3rd level Enchantment (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 24 hours

You weave a delicate fabric of magic around an object, which will trigger an alarm woven into it the moment it is disturbed. The spell is woven over an object together with a designated condition. The condition must be precisely defined, and based on physical events that must occur within 10 yards of the object.

Once the specified condition is met, you are immediately made aware, no matter how far away you may be. Examples of acceptable conditions: a being of a particular species comes within range, a certain person comes within range, anything living moves within range, something comes in contact with or moves the object, and so on.

### Analyze Contraption

3rd-level divination (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 10 feet

Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you gain advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to figure out how a device, trap, or mechanism works. If you are successful on your Investigation check when analyzing a device, you gain advantage on any ability checks used to disarm or operate the object’s mechanisms for the duration.

### Commbander’s Call

3rd level Enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute.

You assume the role of commander on the battlefield. For the duration, as a bonus action you can command one allied creature of your choice that can hear or see you to make a single melee attack.

### Cone of Teeth

3rd-level evocation

Casting time: 1 action

Range: Self (40-foot cone)

Components: V, M (a shark’s tooth)

Duration: Instantaneous

You shape water into thin blades as sharp as a shark’s teeth and grind your enemies in your watery maw. The water extends in a 40-foot cone, dealing 8d6 slashing damage unless the target succeeds at a Constitution saving throw for half damage. The spell leaves a bit of water on the ground (and often blood too), and extinguishes candles and other small flames. When used against fire elementals or other creatures that take damage from water, the spell deals additional damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage in- creases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

### Faithful Guardian

3rd level Conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon a spiritual warrior of your deity that follows your commands. As a bonus action, you can issue one of the following commands.

Attack: Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes radiant damage equal to 1d12 + your Wisdom modifier.

Guard: You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.

### Frigid Smite

3rd-level evocation

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: Self

Components: V

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon is enshrouded in freezing energy, and the attack deals an extra 3d8 cold damage to the target. Additionally, the target is restrained by ice for 1 minute. A creature restrained by the ice can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

At Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

Classes: Paladin

### Gembolt

3rd-level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 200 feet

Duration: Instantaneous

Holding aloft a gemstone, you map tap into the power locked within it, causing it to streak forth in the form of a bolt of energy that shimmers with the same hue as the stone itself, striking a single target in range. This inflicts six dice worth of damage, with the specific die type being based on the quality of the gem: ornamental gems inflict d4s of damage, semiprecious inflict d6s of damage, and precious stones inflict d8s.

This does not consume the gemstone, although you may choose to do so in the casting. In such case, the damage is d6s for ornamental stones, d8s for semiprecious and d10s for precious. All that remains of the stone after the casting is simple, inert grey dust of half the volume of the original stone.

At Higher Level: For each level of spell above 3rd used to cast this spell, increase the damage by one additional die.

Material Component: A gemstone of ornamental, semiprecious or precious quality. This does not usually consume the stone, but you may choose to have the casting of the spell do so in order to inflict additional damage.

### Haste

3rd level Transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft

Components: V, S, M (A shaving of licorice root)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal.

allowing the target of your spell to move slightly faster than everything around it.

Rumors persist that the recipients of this spell age at an unnatural rate, though it is more likely that such stories are an attempt to discourage its use.

Choose a willing creature within 25 feet of you. That creature’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional, hasted action on each of its turns.

The hasted action can be used only for the following actions:

cast a cantrip

make a single attack

disengage

dash

dodge

###  Invisibility Purge

3rd-level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 minute

You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 15ft that negates all forms of invisibility. The first time an invisible creature is in the area or starts their turn there, the invisible creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the spell or effect is considered dispelled and the target cannot benefit from the invisible condition. Spells of 2nd level or lower that provide invisibility are automatically dispelled.

At Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher, increase the radius by 5ft per spell level.

Classes: Cleric

### Journeyman’s Hauberk

3rd-Level Abjuration (Ritual)

Casting Time: 5 Minutes

Range: Self

Components: VSM (100sp of Diamond Dust))

Duration: 7 Days

Perhaps one of the most ubiquitous of spells for the adventuring mage, Journeyman’s Hauberk sits firmly between spells like Mage Armor and Shield, and Mantle or Master’s Lorica as a standby of personal protection and utility. The spell has the following properties:

○ Grants a benefit of +4 to Armor Class

○ Provides a phantom 15 Hit Points, that absorbs or ablates damage.

If these Phantom Hit Points run out, the spell is dispelled.

○ The bearer of the spell benefits from a Protection from Evil enchantment

○ Absorbs Force damage

This damage “recharges” the phantom hit points granted by the armour at a 2:1 ratio.

○ The bearer of the spell has Advantage to all Saving Throws

○ Allows the bearer of the spell to Detect Magic by touch

○ Allows the bearer of the spell to Detect Illusion by touch

This spell is notable in that it requires a rather unique and unalterable material component that is perhaps its sole restriction on use by many mages, and that is 100sp worth of Diamond Dust is needed for each casting. The spell itself produces no visible effect (unlike, say, Phantom Armour) but it’s effects can clearly be seen or perceived by others when they come into play.  No other spells of a similar nature (Mage Armor, Protection from Energy, etc) can be used while this spell is in effect. The spell cannot be Dispelled, nor is it removed by Globes of Invulnerability, and is generally only able to be removed by actual anti-magical effects.

At Higher Levels: When the spell is cast using a spell slot of 4th level of higher it last for an additional day and has an additional 5 phantom hit points, for each spell slot above 3rd that is used.

### Linked Glyphs

3rd-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 300 gp, which the spell consumes)

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a detection glyph that later activates a magical effect at the site of a separate, linked glyph. You inscribe the detection glyph either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the detection glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

Both glyphs are nearly invisible, and finding either requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

You decide what triggers the detection glyph when you cast this spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the detection glyph, choose an alarm glyph or spell glyph to link to it.

Alarm Glyph. You create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. Each of these two glyphs must stay within 100 miles of the other or the spell effect ends. When the detection glyph is triggered, the effect glyph reacts like an alarm spell, creating a mental ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the effect glyph. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

Spell Glyph. You create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. These two glyphs must be within 100 feet of each other. You can store a prepared spell of 4th level or lower in the effect glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyphs. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the detection glyph is triggered, the spell stored in the effect glyph is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on the effect glyph. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the effect glyph. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher to create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use.

Classes: Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Wizard

### Mind Shield

3rd-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 reaction, when you or a target in range are hit with a spell or effect that deals psychic damage or that inflicts the charmed, frightened, or stunned condition

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

You create a mental shield that protects one target within range that you can see. The target has resistance to psychic damage and ends any of the following conditions: charmed, frightened, or stunned and then the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

### Prayer

3rd-level conjuration

Casting Time: Bonus action

Range: 25 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You beseech the gods for special favor to aid yourself and your allies in your present trial.

Choose six creature within range. Until the spell ends, each target gains the blessing of the gods, manifested in a +1 bonus to AC, attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

**At Higher levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

### Scintillating Sphere

3rd-level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 150 ft

Components: V, S, M (copper shavings and a silver of amber)

Duration: Instantaneous

A darting streak of lightning flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then rapidly expands in all directions into a sphere of arcing blue-white electrical bolts. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The electricity spreads around corners.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

### Spell Shield

3rd-level abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

This spell protects the target of the spell from all magic in the following ways:

Target gains advantage on saves against all spells;

Target is immune to all illusion and enchantment spells of 2nd level or lower

The shield generates a pool of 25 points of damage. Half of all magical damage is taken by the shield instead. The spell ends if this damage pool is depleted.

**At Higher Levels.** If this spell is cast using a higher level spell slot, the defended target is rendered immune to illusion and enchantment spells of the level below that for the duration of the protection, and the pool of absorbed damage is increased by 10 per level above 3rd.

### Steelskin

3rd-level transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 minute

You touch one willing creature and transform them into solid steel. This spell transforms the target along with any nonmagical equipment that the target is wearing or carrying. For the duration, the target becomes petrified. This functions as the petrified condition (see Player's Handbook, p. 291), except that the target becomes immune to all damage except fire damage and has resistance to fire damage. The target cannot fall unconscious while transformed in this way, but if the target has 0 hit points when the spell ends, they immediately fall unconscious when the spell ends. The target does not need to make death saving throws while petrified by this spell even if they suffer damage while at 0 hit points.

### Teleport Object

3rd-level alteration

Casting Time: varies

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (a brass key)

Duration: Instant

This spell involves the magical teleportation of objects to a prepared receptacle for them. This spell is cast in one of three ways, depending on the purpose of the spell.

Prepare Receptacle. With this, the caster prepares a receptacle to hold items that he sends into it. It is, in effect, the creation of a "landing pad" for those items, and without at least one such receptacle, the other versions of the spell cannot be cast at all. This casting has a longer Casting Time than normal, taking 1 minute to enchant a container the size of a small chest, 10 minutes to enchant a large chest or crate, 1 hour to enchant a cabinet or wardrobe, and 10 hours to enchant a small room, of a maximum of 20' x 20' in size. A caster may have one such receptacle per point of his Proficiency Bonus. The casting of this spell burns a circular rune-pattern similar to those created by the teleportation circle spell, but on a smaller scale. These patterns are often hidden on the object or room, for if another caster with access to this spell learns the pattern, he may choose to make that receptacle one of his own with a simple casting of this spell.

Banish Item. This has a Casting Time of 1 action. With it, the caster may banish any single item of 10 pounds or less to one of his prepared receptacles, as long as that item will conceivably fit in it. The item must be held by the caster when he casts it, and no one may be contesting his physical possession of it at the time. A bag or container can be banished as a single item, and all its contents will transfer, as long as it does not weigh more than 10 pounds. Items that themselves contain extradimensional space (such as bags of holding) cannot be affected by this spell.

Summon Item. This has a Casting Time of 1 action. With it, the caster may summon any single item of 10 pounds or less from one of his prepared receptacles. The caster must know that the item is in that receptacle, and the item appears in his hand, which must be free and unbound to cast the spell.

At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast at higher levels, it increases the weight and/or number of items that may be summoned or banished. (It has no effect on the Prepare Receptacle function of this spell.) At 4th level, the spell may affect up to two items of no more than 20 lbs in total weight. For each spell level thereafter, the spell may affect one additional item, and 10 additional pounds, allowing a 6th level casting of the spell to affect four items of up to 40 total lbs, as an example.

### Tiny Servant (ERS)

3rd-level transmutation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (if cast as a ritual 100 gp worth of refined oil, which the spell consumes)

Duration: 8 hours

You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See the stat block for its statistics.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.

When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.

Classes: Artificer, Wizard
