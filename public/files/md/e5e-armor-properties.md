## Свойства щитов

**Basher** This shield is well balanced, hardy, and thick. You may make a melee attack with your shield that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you use your shield to successfully shove a creature, you may deal damage to that creature as if you had made an attack with the shield.

**Bashing**  You may attack with a shield with the bashing property as though it were a weapon, rolling the damage dice shown in parenthesis.

**Freehand** The shield is small and secured only by a wrist guard. You do not have to loose or stow your shield to use your shield hand for something else. If you make an attack with a weapon using both hands while wearing this shield or take an action that involves both hands on your turn, you do not benefit from the shield’s Armor Class until the start of your next turn. **Gauntlets**  This armor includes gauntlets.

## Свойства доспехов

**Bulky**  Wearing this armor implies on your mobility. If you will wear another outfit with this trait your effective dexterity will be reduced by 4 and your speed wil be reduced by 1/3

**Cold weather disadvantage** You making saving throws agains effects of cold climate with disadvantage.

**Concealable**  This armor can be worn under normal clothing.  This armor consists of protective reinforcement that can be inconspicuously worn under ordinary looking clothing. When only such armor is worn under clothes, the wearer appears unarmored unless an observer succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the observer has physical contact with the wearer, this check is made with advantage

**Cover**  Shields with the Cover property provide exceptional protection but hinder you in combat. While wielding this shield, your attack rolls are made at disadvantage. Also, all attempts to Overrun or Tumble (pg. 17) through space you occupy are made at disadvantage unless you allow them, and treat your space as difficult terrain. As an action, you can set down a shield with the Cover property as stationary protection. The shield faces in a direction of your choice, and it takes an action to change its orientation while stationary. You benefit from three-quarters cover (+5 AC) instead the shield's bonus to Armor Class, and one adjacent ally standing behind you benefit from half-cover (+2 AC). You can also apply the cover bonus against effects that require a Dexterity saving throw, such as the fireball spell. You get no cover from attacks that pass through other edges of your square

**Cumbersome**  Armors with the Cumbersome property do not distribute their weight across the whole torso. Wearing such armors for more than 8 hours results in prolonged shoulder and back fatigue, and you gain 1 level of Exhaustion. Armors made of mithral lose the Cumbersome property. / Cumbersome. this armor is unwieldy and you have disad¬vantage on all Dexterity checks while wearing it.

**Exhausting**  Даже если в бою доспех не создает особых помех движению и действиям персонажа, он все еще может быть неудобен и тяжел в постоянном ношении. При использовании доспехов с свойством Exhausting КС марш-броска (forced march) увеличен на 5 и персонаж автоматически получает первый уровень истощения после завершения дневного перехода в таком доспехе. Если у персонажа уже был первый уровень истощения, то новый уровень истощения не добавляется.

**Great Helm**  This heavy helmet is more protective than the head covering that normally comes with a suit of armor. It fully encases the head and neck, while a visor fully protects the face. Great helms often bear decorative plumes, crests, or elaborate figurines on top. Wearing a great helm with a suit of medium or heavy armor provides a +2 bonus to saving throws against area spells and effects, like a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball spell. It also grants immunity to the special mechanics of saps and garrotes. Wearing a great helm imposes disadvantage on the wearer's Wisdom (Perception) checks.

**Grip (handles/strip)** There are two types of grips, which determines how you hold a shield: Handles are a simple bar made of metal or wood that function similarly to the hilt of a weapon. A shield with a handle can be doffed or donned with an item interaction and dropped freely, but enemies have advantage on athletics checks made to disarm the user of that shield. Straps attach the shield to the arms, reinforcing the handle^ with a series of cloth or leather bands. These shields take an I action to don or doff, and enemies have disadvantage on athletics checks made to disarm the user. If a shield lists multiple grip types, either can be used, chosen when the shield is obtained or created.

Heated In hot climate character must drink more water, In such armors character must drink in 1,5 times more water then normal.

**Helmet** This armor includes helmet.

**Hidden wearing** You can wear this armor below your regular outfit.

**Hot weather disadvantage** You making saving throws agains effects of hot climate with disadvantage.

**Impeding (Skill)**  You suffer disadvantage on ability checks that involve the listed skill. Skills usually impeded by armor are Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, Sleight of Hand, Perception

**Insulated** This armor counts as cold weather gear in conditions of extreme cold, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

**Layer (Cloaks)** Cloaks is a supplementary layer that covers the body and protects from environmental hazards such as rain or snow, or provides consealment for the facial features, clothing (including light armor) and hands movement. **Freehand** The shield is small and secured only by a wrist guard. You do not have to loose or stow your shield to use your shield hand for something else. If you make an attack with a weapon using both hands while wearing this shield or take an action that involves both hands on your turn, you do not benefit from the shield’s Armor Class until the start of your next turn.

**Layered** Rather than relying upon a single layer of protective material, this armor uses multiple protective layers cleverly constructed to divert and trap missiles (or their fragments) that would otherwise stick in the wearer’s body. Attacks with cruel weapons do not stick in the armor wearer or leave behind pieces that must be removed. A harpoon requires at least 10 points of damage for it to bind and restrain the armor wearer.

**Locking Gauntlet** Built into a suit of metal armor, the fingers of this armored gauntlet are equipped with locking braces designed to keep the wearer from being disarmed. While holding a weapon in the gauntlet, the wearer can use an action to lock the braces with a free hand. Thereafter, the gauntlet wearer automatically keeps hold of a held weapon in a disarming attempt or an application of the Disarming Combat Maneuver. When a weapon is locked in place, the gauntlet wearer cannot put it down or use the hand for anything else. Unlocking the gauntlet also requires another action with a free hand. A locking gauntlet functions as an armor gauntlet if used with unarmed strikes.

**Maximum Dexterity Bonus (x)** In most medium and heavy armors character gains only limited benefit to his Armor Class. This maximum effective Dexterity is noted in table with armor statistics.

**Noisy** This piece of armour has multiple components that often bang together, applying disadvantage to stealth attempts while wearing it. // this armor tends to rattle or otherwise make loud sounds. You have disadvantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks involving hearing. // This type of armor reduces your ability to move quietly, due to metal components striking against each other. When you wear Noisy armor, you suffer disadvantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks that you make to move silently. Other situations, such as hiding without movement or magical silence, are up to the DM.

**Shield Spikes** These sharp studs cover the face of a shield, making it into a convincing weapon. The spikes can be applied to a shield or pavise, but not a buckler or tower shield. When the affected shield is used as an improvised weapon, it inflicts (1d4) piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage. Additionally, when you use the Attack action to shove a creature, you can inflict the spikes' piercing damage if your check succeeds. (Do not add your ability modifier to damage when using the spikes in a shove.) A shield modified with spikes cannot also bear a sconce or an emblem holy symbol.

**Spiked** If you are proficient with exotic weapon spikes then you can make a bonus action to make melee weapon attack with spikes based on your Strength. This weapon attack does 1d4 piercing damage. // This armor has been modified with spikes, barbs, or other similar feature, and deals 1d4 piercing damage to creatures attacking with unarmed strikes or natural weapons that aren't magical.

**Stealth disadvantage** Many types of armors create disadvantages to character when character is trying to hide.
