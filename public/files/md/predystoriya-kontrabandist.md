If people want things, they should be able to have them, no matter what those in charge say. Your job was to ensure that people get what they want.

Smugglers operate on large and small scales. Whether you ran illegal goods across borders in the dead of night, paid off customs agents to ensure your cargo was never searched, or funneled luxuries— and, perhaps, weapons—into a prison, your job was to get things to the people who wanted them. You have faced danger and possibly made yourself an enemy of the state, but that's what's needed to turn a profit.

Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth

Tool Proficiencies: Choose one: vehicles (land), vehicles (water), or forgery kit Languages: One of your choice

Equipment: Spyglass, navigational charts or maps marked with your smuggling routes, hand crossbow, a rowboat or land vehicle of your choice, and a pouch containing 10 gp

### Niche in the Market

While some smugglers will take whatever they can get their hands on, gathering up stocks of illicit goods and hoping to sell them later, others specialize in a particular product. You should decide what you used to smuggle, or else roll on the following table. \\

### Feature: Contacts

You have contacts in every major city in a certain region (e.g. Sword Coast). You may be able to call on them for help—perhaps you need a place to lay low, someone to fence your goods, or help paying off some guards. However, their help is not always reliable, and they will generally not put themselves in direct danger for you except in truly special circumstances.

You may wish to work with your DM to determine exactly who your contacts are and what your relationships with them are like. At a minimum you should decide what form your smuggling took and where you operated.

### Suggested Characteristics

Smugglers are often paranoid, and for good reason— those in power know who they are and will use every means to put a stop to their operations.

Smugglers may seem bold and brash at times, but they are rarely stupid. Everything they do is calculated, everything they say might potentially lead to their downfall if they are not careful, and everyone they meet could easily sell them out if the price is right.

### d8 Personality Trait

I thrive under pressure.

I prefer not to be noticed and find it

uncomfortable to be the center of attention.

I know what people want, and am an expert at providing them with it.

I am always asking questions and observing things. I like to know the lay of the land wherever I am.

I don't use my real name, preferring to operate under a shroud of anonymity.

Money drives me above everything else. I am always thinking in terms of profit and loss.

I am not impulsive. I only take measured risks.

I have surrounded myself with people who would sell me out for the right price, and as a result I find it difficult to trust people.

### Ideal

Greed. I'm only in it for the money. (Evil)

Independence. I am a free spirit—no one tells me what to do. (Chaotic)

Sincerity. There's no point pretending to be something I'm not. (Neutral)

Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)

People. I help people who help me. That's what keeps us alive. (Neutral)

Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade.(Lawful)

### d6 Bond

1    I promised my family I would return with riches and lift them up out of poverty. The thought of being reunited with them is what keeps me going.

2    My word is my bond. I have never cheated or betrayed anyone, and I expect those I deal with to conduct themselves with honesty and respect.

3    I am on the run from people I owe money to. I can never stay in one place long enough for them to catch up to me.

4    I was an honest merchant until an unjust law destroyed my livelihood. Now I smuggle because I refuse to give up on the trade I built my life around.

5    I am slowly building my empire so that I may one day use it to crush the person who screwed me over.

6    I will never forget the monks who took me in after my ship broke apart on the rocks, and I make sure to send them a portion of my profits.

### d6 Flaw

1    Against all my better instincts, I get high on my own supply.

2    Some people find my constant paranoia and mistrust difficult to deal with.

3    The first thing I do when meeting new people is figure out how much it would cost me to put them firmly under my control.

4    Nothing passes through my hands without me taking a cut.

5    Nobody opens with the price they are expecting to take. I will haggle over anything and everything.

6    If I'm not winning, I'm miserable.

### Variant: Agitator

Not all smugglers deal in contraband. Instead, some deal in information. Whether you distribute a rebel newspaper or feed information from inside the government to people in a position to utilize it, you live a life of constant paranoia. Those in power are out to get you, keen to take you down at any cost. You could be under constant surveillance without knowing it; everybody you speak to is a potential government informant. Tread carefully.

### Variant feature: Ear to the ground

You have a finger on the pulse of the city. You know how to sniff out scandal and which threads to pull to unearth the truth. When you are in a city you know well, you are almost always able to find information about people of interest, information that may not be available to those without your network of contacts or your ability to connect seemingly unrelated details.
