### Weapon properties

**Accurate.** Accurate weapons are typified by precise sighting points or aerodynamic features. You gain bonus +1 to ranged weapon attack rolls if target is in normal range of weapon.

**Backswing.** When you make a weapon attack with this weapon and miss, you make the next attack with this weapon on this turn with advantage.

**Bandoleer.** When making a thrown weapon attack, you draw the weapon from an appropriate container or case as part of the attack.

**Bladed.** The damage type of this weapon is piercing or slashing (your choice).

**Bypass.** These flexible weapons wrap around shields and other personal defenses. They ignore the AC bonus granted by shields and parrying weapons or reactions.

**Concealable.** When you attempt to hide a concealable weapon on your person, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to do so.

**Covert.** If you are hidden, a missed ranged attack does not reveal your location.

**Double.** A double weapon has two ends with which you can attack. When you attack with a double weapon, you can make an attack with the other end as a bonus action, dealing the damage indicated in parentheses. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage with this bonus attack.

**Ensnaring.** These weapons feature chain, rope, hooks, or other parts that can aid in entanglement. When you hit with an ensnaring weapon, you can use your bonus action to attempt to shove the target prone, disarm them, or pull them 5 feet towards you, using your weapon attack modifier  in place of Strength (Athletics).

**Entrapping.** When you want to catch and restrain a weapon in combat, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, an entrapment attempt with this weapon. If you have multiple attacks as part of the Attack action, this replaces one of them. The target of your entrapment must be within the reach of your weapon and wielding a melee or ranged weapon. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) (its choice). A creature wielding a weapon in two hands has advantage on this check, and a creature larger than you automatically wins. If you win, the target can't make attacks with the entrapped weapon until the entrapment ends. You can't move out of your weapon's range, make an attack with the entrapping weapon, or drop your own weapon without releasing the entrapped weapon, which you can do at any time. If the target moves or is moved outside your weapon's reach, the entrapment ends and you can use your reaction to attempt to Disarm it (pg. 5) with advantage on your attack roll to do so.

**Hooked.** On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

**Loading (x).** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. To load 1 piece of ammunition to this weapon you need spent number of actions listed in the parentheses of this property

**Long Reach.** When you attack with this weapon on your turn, your reach increases by 10 feet.

**Long.** Weapons with the Long property impose a disadvantage to attacks within 5 feet. You also cannot attempt any combat options or special melee attacks with this weapon against any target within that range.

**Magazine (x).** You can make number of attacks listed in the parentheses of this property with this weapon before it will need reloading.

**Masterwork \[Quality\].** Ranged weapons gain bonus +1 to attack rolls in normal range and melee weapons gain bonus +1 to damage rolls.

**Misfire (x).** If your attack roll before modifiers results in the number listed in the parentheses of this Property, the barrel of the weapon becomes fouled, rendering it inoperable until it is cleaned and recharged, taking fifteen minutes and the use of tinker's tools. Weapons with the Misfire property also become fouled if the weapon is submerged while loaded. If a weapon misfires while you have disadvantage, and both dice are within the misfire range, the weapon explodes, inflicting its damage on all creatures within 5 feet of the weapon, and destroying it.

**Mounted.** This weapon can be used one-handed while mounted but must be used two-handed while on feet.

**Nalatorial.** The Underwater Combat rules do not impose disadvantage on attack rolls with this weapon. All other restrictions apply as normal.

**Not mounted.** This weapon can’t be used by character riding on mount.

**Prone shooting.** When you are prone and make a ranged weapon attack with this weapon, you do not suffer disadvantage for being prone.

**Reserve.** Attacking with this weapon from a prone position does not impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Siege.** This weapon deals double damage dice to structures and objects that are not worn or carried.

**Status.** Status weapons inflict extra effects on powerful hits. When you hit with an attack roll with a status weapon and exceed the target’s AC by 5 or more, it will inflict an additional status effect based upon the type of damage dealt. A critical hit guarantees a status effect. Slashing weapons inflict gaping wounds and profuse bleeding, inflicting additional slashing damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Objects, Constructs, and Elementals are immune to this damage, as may other creatures that do not bleed at the discretion of your GM. Bludgeoning weapons hit with staggering blows that daze the target. Inflicting this status causes the target’s next attack roll to be made with disadvantage. Piercing weapons reward precise or focused attacks, punching holes in defenses and leaving a target vulnerable. Inflicting piercing status grants advantage on the first weapon attack against the target before the start of its next turn. Improvised weapons may inflict status depending on their damage type and the discretion of your GM.

**Versatile damage.** Weapons with this quality have both a primary and a secondary damage type. Your weapon will always do the primary damage type unless you declare otherwise before you roll damage.

**Vicious.** If a weapon with the Vicious property deals damage, you may reroll any of the weapon dice if it rolls a value of 1. You must use the new value even if it is also a 1. If you have the Great Weapon Fighting style, the two rerolls stack to 1-3 instead.

**Worn.** Weapons with the Worn property are equipped in a way similar to armor, by strapping it firmly to the body. It takes up to 1 minute to don or doff the weapon or shield, and character can do it as part of donning or doffing armor. The GM may allow you to skip the required time if you ignore the Worn property of the weapon or shield until the end of combat. While the weapon or shield benefits from the Worn property, it cannot be disarmed.
